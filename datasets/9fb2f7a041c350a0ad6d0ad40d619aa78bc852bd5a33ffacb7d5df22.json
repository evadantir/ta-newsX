  "text": "The Chicago Cubs shed themselves of the \"Curse of the Billy Goat\" and ended a 108-year wait for a World Series title when Ben Zobrist hit a go-ahead double in the 10th inning beating the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in 10 in a thrilling Game Seven classic in the early hours of Thursday. The triumph of Chicago's beloved Cubbies set off a wild celebration in the streets of the Windy City after more than a century of pent up frustration for fans since their last Major League Baseball championship in 1908. Loveable losers for generations, the Cubs nearly let this one get away, too. All-Star closer Aroldis Chapman blew a three-run lead with two outs in the eighth when Rajai Davis hit a tying homer. But the Cubs, after tormenting their fans one more time, came right back after a 17-minute rain delay before the top of the 10th and scored twice. Davis hit an RBI single with two outs in the bottom half, but Mike Montgomery got the final out. Manager Joe Maddon's team halted the longest title drought in baseball, becoming the first club to overcome a 3-1 Series deficit since the 1985 Kansas City Royals. Cleveland was trying to win its first crown since 1948, but lost the last two games at home. World Series favorites since spring training, Chicago led the majors with 103 wins this season. The Cubs then ended more than a century of misery for their loyal fans. Chicagoans will only half-jokingly speak of the Billy Goat curse. According to the legend, Billy Sianis – owner of the Billy Goat Tavern  was kicked out of a game in 1945 because of foul odour of his pet goat was upsetting fans. Outraged, he then cursed the club and declared it would not win another World Series. Everybody was watching the never-ending game: Twitter was split between watching the match and watching Chicago fan Bill Murray watching the match. The Indians came back from a 6-3 deficit in the eighth inning and has a chance to close the game in the ninth. Cleveland native and NBA superstar LeBron James got very very excited: Flex on 'em, LeBron (via @JabariJYoung)#WorldSeriespic.twitter.com/wJy2Hgk6EO—Jason McIntyre (@jasonrmcintyre) 3 November 2016. James's Cleveland teammate JR Smith also removed his shirt to spark Cleveland's late rally, echoing his championship celebration from earlier in the year. @TheRealJRSmith took off his shirt to inspire an @Indians rally ...It worked: https://t.co/p5rtMeLR8S #Game7 pic.twitter.com/CSP8upImPR— Cut4 (@Cut4) 3 November 2016. With the game going to extra innings, presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton was able to cheer her hometown Chicago Cubs in the final moments of the match after finishing a rally in Arizona Wednesday night. She watched on an aide's iPad as she stood by her idling motorcade.",
