Pertamina increases Pertalite gasoline price,"State-owned energy company Pertamina increased the price of Pertalite-branded gasoline to Rp 7,800 (55 US cents) per liter on Saturday, Rp 200 higher than the previous price. The 90 RON gasoline has become a widely used alternative for customers typically preferring the subsidized Premium brand, such as drivers of public transportation minivans and motorcyclists, because gas stations in Greater Jakarta frequently run out of Premium stocks. The new price is for gas stations in Java, Bali, Nusa Tenggara, Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra, while Pertalite is sold at Rp 8,150 per liter in Riau and Riau Islands and at Rp 8,000 per liter in other Sumatra provinces. The fuel also costs Rp 8,000 in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua. Pertamina regional marketing operation I (MOR I) spokesman Rudi Arifianto said in Riau's provincial capital of Pekanbaru on Sunday that the company had to increase the price because of the increasing global crude oil prices and the weakening of the rupiah against the US dollar. \""Fuel is a global commodity where we cannot control the price. If the global oil price declines and the rupiah exchange rate strengthens, we will revise down the price,\"" he said, as reported by Antara. On Feb. 24, Pertamina increased the prices of several other non-subsidized fuels. The price of Pertamax per liter was increased to Rp 8,900 (62 US cents) from Rp 8,600, while the price of Pertamax Turbo per liter was increased to Rp 10,000 from Rp 9,600. The price of Pertamina Dex per liter was raised to Rp 10,000 from Rp 9,250 and the price of Dexlite per liter to Rp 8,100 from Rp 7,500."

It's official: Prabowo to join 2019 race,"Gerindra Party chairman and chief patron Prabowo Subianto accepted his party's mandate to run for the presidency at its national coordination meeting in Hambalang, West Java, on Wednesday.His decision ended speculation over whether he was considering sitting the election out to endorse another candidate in the 2019 race. It also increased the likelihood that the upcoming election sees a rematch between the former commander of the Army's Special Forces and President Joko \""Jokowi\"" Widodo.\""As the party's mandatary, as the holder of your mandate [...] I declare that I have submitted and complied with your decision,\"" Prabowo said in a video of the closed-door meeting provided by a Gerindra politician.Earlier in the day, the opposition leader made it clear that he would only contest the election if the party built a strong alliance with other parties.Arriving to the meeting's main stage on horseback, to the strains of a brassy rendition of traditional marching song \""The British Grenadiers\"", Prabowo cut an imposing figure in Gerindra's trademark white shirt, khaki pants, and black peci fez.\""With all my energy, body and soul, if Gerindra orders me to run in the upcoming presidential election, I am ready to carry out that task,\"" he said, according to a Gerindra politician that was present, to the applause of the party members in attendance, who broke out in chants of \""Prabowo, president!\""Prabowo cut off the chanting, however, and asked for patience.\""I said 'if', 'if the party orders me,'\"" he said. \""There is one condition. Even if the party orders me [to run], I need the support of friendly parties.\"" Over the past few weeks, Prabowo has seemed hesitant over whether to run against President Jokowi again.Maksimus Ramses Lalongkoe, the executive director of the Institute of Indonesian Political Analysis, said Prabowo's apparent hesitation rested mostly on the lack of a clear coalition backing his candidacy.The 2017 Elections Law specifies that political parties seeking to nominate a presidential candidate are required to secure at least 20 percent of seats at the House of Representatives or 25 percent of the popular vote.Gerindra currently holds only 13 percent of House seats and 11.81 percent of the popular vote, which means it needs to join forces with other parties to be able to nominate Prabowo or any other potential candidate.Four parties with significant vote shares have yet to officially back a candidate: the National Mandate Party (PAN), the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), the National Awakening Party (PKB) and the Democratic Party (PD).PAN and the PKS have worked together with Gerindra in recent times, most notably during the contentious Jakarta gubernatorial election last year.A Gerindra official has said that Prabowo might declare his candidacy in Banyumas, Central Java, should the party secure the support of PAN and the PKS.However, PAN seems reluctant about unequivocally endorsing Prabowo, with its chairman Zulkifli Hasan, who attended the Gerindra meeting, saying that the party had yet to make a decision. \""If the PDI-P [Jokowi's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle] invited us, we would also come and speak,\"" he said as quoted by Antara.Gerindra and the PKS have enough seats at the House to nominate Prabowo, but it is likely that Prabowo is seeking more support to match a much bigger political alliance behind Jokowi, who has the backing of five parties.Maksimus said Indonesia's dynamic political landscape meant that parties were still looking to see what moves might give them the edge. \""They're still doing a lot of maneuvering, trying to see if one of their own members has a chance at running,\"" he said.Prabowo has struggled to match Jokowi's electability, which is at 45 to 55 percent, but Maksimus said that such a challenge was unlikely to be the cause of his indecision. \""Electability can change very quickly, Jokowi's electability can be high now, but who knows what it will be like on election day.\""He added that Prabowo had no other choice but to run as other potential candidates, such as former Indonesian Military chief Gatot Nurmantyo and Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan, would not motivate the party machine in the same way that Prabowo would.Nevertheless, he did not dismiss out of hand the possibility of Prabowo pairing up with erstwhile adversary Jokowi, once again citing the fast-moving nature of Indonesian politics.\""If Prabowo is backed into a corner, then he might well decide to join forces with Jokowi, rather than leave empty-handed.\"""

"Prabowo, Luhut hold closed-door meeting, may talk 2019 election","Opposition leader Prabowo Subianto held a closed-door meeting with Luhut Pandjaitan, a key figure in the President Joko \""Jokowi\"" Widodo administration, at a hotel in Central Jakarta on Friday, a Prabowo's aide has said. Gerindra Party deputy secretary-general Andre Rosiade said on Saturday that the two political figures had likely discussed the 2019 presidential election. Prabowo, the chief patron of Gerindra, is reportedly considering whether he will challenge President Jokowi again in the upcoming election. He lost to Jokowi in the highly divisive presidential election in 2014. The meeting has sparked speculation of possible efforts by Jokowi's inner circle to bring Prabowo into Jokowi's camp. As of today, the former Army's Special Forces (Kopassus) commander has yet to officially declare his candidacy, while a new figure, former Indonesian Military (TNI) commander Gatot Nurmantyo, has emerged as one of the strongest challengers for Jokowi. The General Elections Commission (KPU) will open registration for presidential candidates in August. Andre, however, was quick to dismiss such speculation, saying the party was committed to nominating Prabowo as its presidential candidate again. \""That was just a friendly meeting between two old friends.\"" A number of Gerindra executives had announced the party would declare Prabowo's presidential candidacy during its national coordination meeting slated for April 11. However, Prabowo said on Thursday that there would be no declaration of his candidacy during the meeting as the party had yet to form a firm alliance. With only 73 seats at the House of Representatives, Gerindra would have to form an alliance to field a candidate in a presidential election as stipulated by the 2017 Election Law. Several politicians, including House Speaker Bambang Soesatyo, have hinted at the possibility of pairing Jokowi with Prabowo in the 2019 presidential election to prevent political polarization in 2019. However, Gerindra officials have rejected such a proposal. Gerindra's central executive board chairman, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, also played down the political significance of Friday's meeting between Prabowo and Luhut, saying such a meeting was not unusual. \""Both of them are former generals and former business partners.\"" "
