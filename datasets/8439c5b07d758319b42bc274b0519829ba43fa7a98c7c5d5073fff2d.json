  "text": "The jaw-dropping brilliance of Max Verstappen, who leapfrogged both Kimi Raikkonen and Nico Rosberg before charging from 16th place to finish third in Brazil, took even his own father aback. There had been plenty of signs of the teenager's astonishing talent on show this season, but nothing quite like this. \"I must say that he surprised me,\" said father, Jos, who competed in Formula One from 1994 to 2003. \"I've seen many races of this, and this was incredible. Although Red Bull didn't have the right strategy and were unlucky with the weather, it was almost worth them having a bad stop to see what he did afterwards. It's good for F1, everyone is enthusiastic. What more do you want?\" Equally enraptured was Niki Lauda, the former world champion and Mercedes' non-executive chairman. Congratulating the Verstappen family, he said: \"Max was outstanding with the passes he performed. He did a job that was impressive. I knew the guy was good, but he has proved again to everybody what he can do.\". Asked about his achievement, Verstappen replied, with a mischievous grin: \"Second was definitely possible. Sometimes you have to gamble.\". As for the winner, Lewis Hamilton, he left Nico Rosberg in little doubt about the pressure he would put him under at this year's final grand prix in Abu Dhabi in two weeks, after cutting a 34-point deficit in the drivers' championship to 12. \"I'm hunting,\" he said. \"All I can do is what I'm doing right now.\". Rosberg should be wary of the momentum that his team-mate will carry into the season's climax. Hamilton has been a driver possessed these past three races, reasserting his alpha-male belligerence at Mercedes to leave the German struggling to respond. The sheer conviction of his display here showed that, while the odds might be against him, he had no intention of relenting. \"I have to keep this up,\" Hamilton said. \"Nico has finished every race this year apart from Barcelona, where neither of us finished. It will be very tough to beat him, but I am going to take what I have and push as hard as I can.\". It was striking how, for the pandemonium that engulfed this rain-drenched race, Hamilton claimed that it was one of the easiest he had experienced. He had never won in Brazil but corrected the omission with some peerless front-running on a soaking, stop-start afternoon. \"I feel very grateful, incredibly happy,\" he said. \"This is a place that I have dreamt of winning at since I was a child. It's a hard grand prix to win. But honestly, it was the smoothest-sailing race I have had for about 10 years. The emotions will take a while to sink in.\"",
