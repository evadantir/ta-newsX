  "text": "Musician Lady Gaga, a prominent supporter of Hillary Clinton, was photographed protesting outside Trump Tower in New York City in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The star stood on a sanitation truck, holding a sign reading 'Love trumps hate.' A Trump Tower clock can be seen in the background. Lady Gaga had been seen in tears earlier in the evening while sat backstage at Clinton's election night party, according to MSNBC Political Correspondent Kasie Hunt. As it became clear that Donald Trump would become the next president of the United States, Gaga tweeted: \"In a room full of hope, we will be heard. Stand up for kindness, equality, and love. Nothing will stop us. Say a prayer America\". Speaking at a Clinton campaign rally earlier this week, the singer spoke passionately in support of the Democratic candidate, saying: \"She has a career in politics that spans decades of experience, education, leadership, and wisdom. She's ready to be president. She kept going and she kept fighting for women's rights. She kept fighting for the care of our children. She kept fighting for those that are in need.\". On the subect of trump, she said; \"If we are true, true Americans, we must go from viewing his followers as our adversaries to viewing them as our allies. What does she say? What do we say? We are stronger together. And what I see in this remarkable woman is that she is ready to restore peace in this country. America is not America without its people.\". Trumpâ€™s triumph in the election was confirmed at shortly before 7.30am GMT. In a victory speech less than an hour later he offered generous words for his vanquished opponent, saying she had worked hard for many years and was owed a \"deep debt of gratitude\". He added:  \"We will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will deal fairly with everyone. We will seek common ground, partnership not conflict. \"America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our destiny.\"",
