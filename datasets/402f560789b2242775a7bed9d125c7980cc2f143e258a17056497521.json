  "text": "Hillary Clinton has blamed her defeat in the US election on James Comey, the FBI director, who announced days before the votes were cast that he was reopening the investigation into her handling of classified information. During a conference call with top donors on Saturday, Mrs Clinton said that Mr Comey's intervention in the election had reversed her \"momentum\" and energised Donald Trump's supporters. Mr Comey's announcement, made on Oct 28 in a brief letter to members of Congress, caused the Democratic presidential nominee to tumble in the polls and revived Mr Trump's hopes of victory. However, Mrs Clinton's campaign appeared to steady itself days after the new broke and she re-established her polling lead prior to election day. By the time Mr Comey issued a second letter on Nov 4 clearing Mrs Clinton, it seemed she was once again destined for victory. That victory did not materialise, leaving Mrs Clinton and her team searching for answers. She has now concluded, according to individuals who took part in the call and have spoken to US media, that Mr Comey is to blame. On call with top donors this afternoon, Hillary Clinton said she was \"heartbroken\" by her loss — Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) November 12, 2016. Speaking to the donors, all of whom gave at least $100 million to her campaign, Mrs Clinton faulted the FBI director for \"raising doubts\" about her so close to the election. In thank-you call with top donors @HillaryClinton blames first Comey letter for stopping her momentum and second for energizing Trump voters — Anne Rumsey Gearan (@agearan) November 12, 2016. \"There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,\" she said, according to The New York Times, \"our analysis is that Comey's letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.\". That analysis was echoed by Navin Nayak, the head of the Clinton campaign's opinion research division. \"We believe that we lost this election in the last week. Comey's letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters - particularly in the suburbs,\" Mr Nayak wrote in an email obtained by Politico. \"We also think Comey's second letter, which was intended to absolve Secretary Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump's turnout,\" he added. Mr Nayak said Mrs Clinton had been on the verge of victory until the final week when \"everything changed\".",
