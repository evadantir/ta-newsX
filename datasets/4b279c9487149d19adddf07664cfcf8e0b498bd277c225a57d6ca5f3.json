  "text": "Explosion and gunfire reported outside German consulate in Afghanistan. The blast was followed by gunfire according to reports on the ground. A car laden with explosives apparently initiated the attack at the compound's security wall, followed by gunfire and an explosion inside the hotel. There have been at least two fatalities and 84 people have been taken to hospital. The attack happened at around 11:30pm local time, close to the consulate and a hotel as well as several guesthouses. Residents of the area have said it felt as if the bomb \"shook the whole city\" while others report seeing \"body parts\" on the ground. The taliban have taken responsibility for the attack. A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, called the attack a reprisal for airstrikes in Kunduz this week. Witnesses have described hearing heavy bursts of gunfire after the explosion. People in the area have claimed the gunfire may have been from German soldiers to hold potential attackers back from the consulate. NATO troops have been deployed to the scene, a German military spokesman told Reuters, confirming that shots had been heard outside the consulate. Alliance troops are now investigating the blast, he added.

The provincial government said an explosives-laden vehicle had been detonated outside the consulate, causing damage and casualties. The blast blew out windows in numerous buildings in the area. Mazar-i-sharif is the third-largest city of Afghanistan, with a population of 693,000. German troops have been based in northern Afghanistan for years. After the end of the formal NATO combat mission in 2015, roughly 1,000 German service members have remained based near Mazar-i-Sharif, mostly responsible for training and supporting the Afghan security forces.",
