Trump said the meeting lasted longer than expected and easily could have gone longer The Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump and President Obama met for the first time Thursday and pledged to work together starting the whirlwind transition that will unfold over the next 10 weeks until Trump is sworn into office Jan 20 Trump later met with House Speaker Paul D Ryan R-Wis at the Capitol and said they also would work together -- but on Republican goals that are opposed by Obama and his fellow Democrats Were going to lower taxes Trump told reporters with Ryan seated by his side Were going to fix health care and make it affordable and better He appeared to be referring to a plan to lower taxes that heavily benefits top earners and to the GOPs aim of repealing the Affordable Care Act Obamas signature domestic policy achievement Following his meeting with Ryan Trump conferred with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R in the Kentucky senators Capitol office An hour and a half after Trump entered the White House through the South Lawn entrance -- avoiding news cameras and the presidents staff -- a group of reporters was ushered into the Oval Office where the president and president-elect were seated in the high-backed armchairs at the end of the room In a sign of how tensions between the two politicians have not disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the election the White House did not arrange for the traditional photo-op between the current first couple and the incoming one a custom that George W Bush and his wife Laura observed when the Obamas visited the White House in 2008 Melania Trump met separately with Michelle Obama Trump maps out a new administration to bring a seismic shift to Washington Still Trump told reporters Thursday that he expects to work closely with Obama now and in the future to seek his advice in guiding the country He noted that a session that was supposed to last 10 to 15 minutes went on for an hour and a half As far as Im concerned it could have lasted a lot longer Trump said We discussed a lot of different situations some wonderful and some difficulties I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future including counsel So Mr President it was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many many more times in the future he added calling Obama a very good man 1 of 22 Full

Thursday morning We want to make sure they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition Obama said Most of all I want to emphasize to you Mr President-elect that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed -- because if you succeed then the country succeeds Trumps victory exposes Obamas inability to connect with white working class Later Trump and his wife along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence met with Ryan at the Capitol where Trump pledged to work closely with Republican congressional leaders Ryan ushered Trump out onto the Speakers Balcony and

with Trumps transition team citing the close working relationship he enjoyed with President George W Bush during their transfer of power eight years ago The White House said that Pence met with Vice President Biden in the afternoon I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bushs team set eight years ago and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect Obama said in the Rose Garden on Wednesday The president said he called to congratulate Trump early Wednesday morning after news networks had formally announced Trump as the winner over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after the meeting that the two men did not try to resolve all of their differences but he said it was a little less awkward than reporters might have anticipated Obama and Trump met privately without any other staff in the room A large part of the Oval Office session was devoted to talking about how to staff and organize the White House Thats complicated business Earnest said noting that presidents have to deal with multiple challenges and crises at the same time It is something President Obama has thought about extensively over the past eight years Obama had denounced Trump as temperamentally unfit for the White House during a long and brutal campaign But he said that we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy And over the next few months we are going to show that to the world Trump and Clinton already had been receiving national-security briefings as the nominees of the two major political parties The White House said Thursday that Obama has convened a coordinating council to facilitate a smooth transition including providing briefings from federal agencies to Trumps transition team headed by New Jersey Gov Chris Christie R Officials from the Trump transition team are starting to set up shop in agencies across the federal government where they can consult with top Obama officials as they assemble their staffs The current White House has already begun to transfer a massive amount of information to the National Archives and Records Administration so far it has sent 283 million files comprising 122000 gigabytes of data In an interview Wednesday White House communications director Jennifer Psaki said the president has talked privately with his staff as well as publicly about putting institutional interests ahead of political ones Referring to the speeches Obama delivered upon winning the presidency and at his first inaugural she said He reflects a lot about the cog in the wheel that you are as president He was taking the baton hes handing it off But I think its a recognition that its bigger than individual aspirations and its bigger than yourself and bigger than anything that youve accomplished Because we as a country need to be stable need to have continuity In the wake of protests over Trumps win Earnest said that while the president believes the protesters have a right to express their opinions his message to them is that were Americans and patriots first and that an orderly transfer of power ranks as a top White House priority Ohio Gov John Kasich R who ran unsuccessfully in the GOP presidential primary and harshly criticized Trump was at the White House on Thursday to attend Obamas ceremony for the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing Kasich said he saw people protesting Trumps election as he entered the White House gates and he called for unity I just want to remind everyone in our country that the office of the presidency needs to be respected he said Today I said my prayers on the plane for the success of Donald Trump And I think as Americans we all need to come together There is long-standing bad blood between Trump and Obama after the New York businessman led a public campaign to try to force the president to disclose his long-form birth certificate in 2011 over unfounded questions from some conservatives who thought the president was not born in the United States As a candidate Donald Trump vowed to dismantle some of President Obamas key achievements Washington Post White House reporter David Nakamura breaks down what the Obama administration is worried about going forward Sarah ParnassThe Washington Post During the White House Correspondents Association dinner that year Obama lit into Trump mocking him before a ballroom of 2000 guests and on live television During the campaign Trump promised to repeal the presidents signature health-care law and overturn many of his executive actions Obama said Trump was not to be trusted with the nations nuclear codes and represented an existential threat to democracy Obama sought to play down their differences and said Trumps victory speech was magnanimous and set the right tone to help try to heal the nations political divisions that were exposed and inflamed over the past 15 months They do not have an extensive personal relationship Earnest said Wednesday drawing laughs from reporters This is not a situation where theyve had many conversations or played golf together or any of that business So I guess that will be among the many many many reasons that tomorrows meeting will be rather

Max Verstappen was born on September 30 1997 in Belgium - The teenager is the son of Dutch former F1 driver Jos Verstappen - He made his F1 debut as a 17-year-old for Toro Rosso in Australia in 2015 - the youngest ever to do so - Verstappen has won one of his 38 races in Formula One and has gained six podium finishes - He currently sits fifth in the drivers championship standings The young Dutchman then produced one of the drives of the season as he sliced his way through the field from 16th to third as the rain continued to fall having found himself stranded down the field after being caught out by one of the numerous yellow flags deployed during the race The safety car which appears on the track to lead drivers round following a crash was deployed five times during the race while a red flag was produced twice - taking the drivers off the track as conditions became too bad to race in This is just mad said a furious Sebastian Vettel who also spun earlier in the race over the team radio Stupid What this race needs is a red flag How many people do we want to crash It was a difficult afternoon for the race organisers with some drivers calling for the grand prix to be abandoned due to hazardous conditions Hamilton was not among their number It is understandable for the first red flag with everyone going off he said Kimi Raikkonen was fortunate to see his other Formula One drivers avoid colliding into his car Raikkonens Ferrari is removed from the track following his crash which brought a red flag Felipe Massa also crashed out of the race his last in his homeland before his retirement I dont really understand why the second stop came But safety comes first and obviously it was thought it was needed This is Formula One and the rain is the trickiest condition If people didnt make mistakes it would be too easy and everyone could do it We run at serious speeds and there is a lot of water to disperse by the tyres and they struggle the faster we go The champagne was flowing once again for Lewis Hamilton left after he won in Brazil Hamilton led the race in Brazil from start to finish after winning from pole position Hamilton revealed victory in Brazil had been an ambition of his since watching Ayrton Senna FOR HAMILTON TO WIN THE TITLE He must win in Abu Dhabi and hopes Rosberg finishes fourth or lower If Rosberg finishes third in Abu Dhabi on Nov 27 he wins the championship While Verstappen was one of a number of drivers involved in dramatic incidents during the race things proved to be a lot more simple for Hamilton as he produced a masterful drive in the wet to win the race from pole position The victory meant the reigning world champion stays in the race to win this years title but he faces a tough task to overhaul team-mate and rival Nico Rosberg at the final Grand Prix of the season in Abu Dhabi on Sunday I was genuinely chilling up front he said When it rains it is usually good for me There were no mistakes no issues no spins It was interesting hearing about so many people having slips but I didnt have any;Formula One star Max Verstappen shows nerves of steel to avoid serious accident;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-3934424/Formula-One-star-Max-Verstappen-shows-nerves-steel-avoid-accident.html;{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'avoid serious accident', u'coderPhraseCount': 3}], u'label': u'what'};{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'Brazilian Grand Prix', u'coderPhraseCount': 2, u'parsed': u'2016-11-13'}], u'label': u'when'};{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'Interlagos circuit', u'coderPhraseCount': 2}, {u'text': u'Brazilian Grand Prix', u'coderPhraseCount': 2}, {u'text': u'Brazil', u'coderPhraseCount': 2}], u'label': u'where'};{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'Max Verstappen', u'coderPhraseCount': 3}], u'label': u'who'};{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'lost control', u'coderPhraseCount': 2}], u'label': u'why'}

steps onto the stage to deliver her concession speech Melina MaraThe Washington Post Hillary Clinton blamed the renewed FBI inquiry into her State Department email system for blunting her momentum in the presidential election and the closure of that inquiry two days before Election Day for energizing voters for Donald Trump There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful Clinton told top donors on a farewell conference call Saturday But our analysis is that FBI Director James B Comeys letter raising doubts that were groundless baseless proven to be stopped our momentum she said A series of strategic mistakes likely sealed Clintons fate We dropped and we had to keep really pushing ahead to regain our advantage -- which going into the last weekend we had We were once again up in all but two of the battleground states and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing And we were feeling like we had put it back together she continued Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said the letter from FBI Director James Comey announcing an inquiry into additional emails was pretty strange and unprecedented with days to go before Election Day Clinton told supporters at a rally in Daytona Beach Fla that voters deserve to get full and complete facts The Washington Post The surprise announcement of a revival of the shuttered FBI inquiry came at a time when the campaign was riding high Clinton said After the third debate we felt so good about where we were she said Trumps performance in the Oct 19 debate was widely panned especially his refusal to say that he would respect the outcome of the election if he lost Democrats called him a sore loser We were up considerably in all but two of the battleground states where we were tied or one behind according to our data Clinton said We were tied in Arizona We just had a real wind at our back before the first stunning letter from Comey Clintons campaign insisted the reopened inquiry would turn up nothing and many Democrats accused Comey of partisan motives He was once a registered Republican Comey has not commented publicly on either letter His defenders have said there was no partisan intent and that he should not be blamed for Clintons loss to an opponent who ultimately had a deeper well of support among voters Clinton did not accuse Comey of partisanship Saturday But she did say that what should have been good news essentially backfired Comey issued another letter to Congress on the Sunday before Election Day concluding that the nine-day examination of newly discovered emails had turned up nothing to change his earlier conclusion that there had been no criminal conduct Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would -- saying there was no there there -- was a real motivator for Trumps voters Clinton said A day earlier Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri had told the same group of donors something similar -- that the news angered Trump voters and caused a spike in turnout while Clintons projected turnout fell Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally and the result is the result Clinton said Signs of trouble on Clintons last day on the trail The Democrat focused on the outside events she said affected her campaign in the last three weeks of the election She said nothing about other larger forces at work -- Trumps message of change in a restive time his pledge to represent the aggrieved working class the difficulty of any political party winning a third consecutive presidential term her own limited attention to economic anxiety or the sexism and discomfort that surrounded her attempt

she said Saturday with a sad laugh Im not going to pretend otherwise This is a very very tough loss and especially because everyone worked so hard Before Clinton spoke Saturday her finance director had congratulated the group of top fundraisers for bringing in more than half of the nearly 1 billion raised for Clintons campaign The National Finance Committee as it was known was made up of donors who amassed or bundled at least 100000 in donations from others Finance director Dennis Cheng ran through numbers that illustrate how heavily Clinton relied upon big donors;Hillary Clinton blames one

u'label': u'how'};text/xml;washingtonpost-5;true;washingtonpost;FBI Director James B Comey MICHAEL REYNOLDSEuropean Pressphoto Agency If you have ever watched a procedural crime drama you probably recognize the words the jury will disregard It is the instruction judges give jurors to ignore inadmissible testimony after it has already been offered in open court Of course the jury composed of human beings cannot forget what it has already heard -- even if they try The integrity of the proceedings have already been damaged Director James B Comey announced Sunday that the FBIs sweep through a fresh cache of emails related to Hillary Clintons private server found nothing big -- the agency concluded once again that the Democratic nominee does not deserve to be charged with a crime The news comes a little over a week after he revealed that the FBI had found the email cache -- and said little else In the intervening time Donald Trump and other top Republicans insisted Comey had obviously found something damning Headlines about the FBI reopening its probe against Clinton swirled Leaks from within the FBI muddied the political waters further Yet the speed with which the FBI reviewed the material that produced this explosion of speculation suggests it must have been irrelevant or copies of emails previously reviewed In other words Comey is now asking the voters to disregard the fog of suspicion he created around Clinton Voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio weigh in on FBI Director James Comeys decision to send a letter to members of Congress informing them that newly discovered emails were either duplicates or personal emails that were not related to government business from Hillary Clintons time as secretary of state Peter StevensonErin Patrick OConnorWhitney LeamingThe Washington Post Its too late Millions of voters cast ballots over the last week Many others have no doubt spent the time conceptualizing the race as one between a crook and a crazy man It turns out that the race is in fact between a relatively conventional politician who has been for decades accused of grand crimes and a dangerous man who has substantiated many of the alarming claims made about him For his part over the past week Trump has run a markedly more restrained competent campaign No matter what else it did Comey reopening the email issue appears to have reinvigorated Trumps once-flagging effort From here it is not even clear that Comeys 11th-hour exoneration will help Clinton on Election Day Though the big story of the race should be that a plainly unqualified man is scarily close to the presidency the news cycle will spend another day dwelling on Clinton emails the roiling emotions in the FBI about the case and because of Trump and his propagandists whether the FBI director is part of a conspiracy to rig the system to help Clinton Even if Clinton pulls through as polls suggest is likely the damage will still be substantial Republicans have used the Comey affair as pretext to publicly discuss impeaching Clinton arguing that if it seems as though an indictment is looming Congress will step in to remove the president Though no indictment is now coming Republican politicians have already stoked expectations that they will push for impeachment Even if they resist doing so Comeys behavior will become more evidence that the system is rigged fueling the right-wing grievance machine and the coming campaign to declare Clintons presidency illegitimate A Clinton first term was always going to be tough marked by deep political divisions After Comeys actions it will be even harder for Republicans to do anything but assail and prosecute Clinton to the extent the legislative branch can -- regardless of what the country actually needs from its leaders Then there is the already well-documented damage that Comeys behavior and the leaks that followed it did to the image of the FBI as an apolitical law enforcement organization Comey may have felt boxed in trapped in a promise he made to Congress to keep lawmakers informed of any developments in the Clinton email investigation But there is a reason why law enforcement agencies keep out of electoral politics except when absolutely necessary There is a reason why when they must say something they have an obligation to be careful about what they make public and how Not as Comey did dropping a vague note near the end of a hot presidential campaign that insufficiently stressed that the new email cache may have nothing of relevance in it The damage -- both to the interests of justice and the integrity of our democracy -- can be substantial wide-ranging and impossible to disregard;Comey to country The jury will

Both men sat well beyond the social distance apart with their legs at full splay which is a ritual of superiority that is more about machismo than intellect or job titles It showed a very basic animosity below what looked like a desire to signal a relaxed and casual meet-up Trumps steepled hands added to this air of competitive masculinity and he even tapped his fingers together with a look of impatience to get on with the job - There was some weak joking towards the end then Trump turned Obamas dismissive offer of a stretched hand to shake into a much more enthusiastic gesture by grabbing the hand and pumping it warmly - The eye expressions and lack of mutual eye contact probably said it all though Trump is having his waxwork made for Tussauds but it looked from the dead eye expressions as though both men had used their wax dummies as body double stand-ins for the meeting He added And I believe that it is important for all of us regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together work together to deal with the many challenges that we face The Democrat said that his wife First Lady Michelle Obama had spent some time with Trumps wife Melania and revealed his family wanted them to feel welcome in the White House EPA 18 Reaching outObama said he was encouraged by Trumps attitude during their meeting Getty Images 18 Trump had another awkward encounter this time with Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan who he clashed with during his campaign Reuters 18 House Speaker Ryan shows Donald and Melania Trump the Mall in Washington DC The White House 18 First Ladies Melania and Michelle looked a little less awkward in their photo After meeting with Obama the new President-elect had lunch with Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan Trump and Ryan repeatedly clashed during the campaign over the billionaires divisive policies After lunch Trump and vice-president elect Mike Pence had a meeting with US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Trump flew from New York on his private jet today and landed at Reagan National Airport just outside the capital Trumps motorcade took a South Lawn entrance into the White House out of view of television cameras Obama and Trump held a brief photo opportunity in the Oval Office while the full transition of power will officially take place on January 20 Getty Images 18 Mitch McConnell centre smiles as he walks with President-elect Donald Trump with his wife Melania and Vice President-elect Mike Pence Previously Trump championed the so-called Birther movement challenging that Obama was actually born in the US Democrat Obama in turn has described the celebrity businessman as uniquely unqualified to be president White House chief of staff Denis McDonough was seen taking a walk around the South Lawn driveway with Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner A handful of other Trump aides trailed behind McDonough and Kushner who is married to Trumps daughter Ivanka and was one of his closest advisers during the campaign Sky News 18 Donald Trump leaves his private jet as he makes his way to the White House Getty Images 18 Trump aides including Dan Scavino left arrive at the White House Trump lands in Washington ahead of meeting Obama in the White House Getty Images 18 Obama administration officials stand on a balcony hoping to catch a glimpse of Trump Vice President Joe Biden also had a meeting with Vice President-elect Mike Pence Obama has said Trumps team will start working directly with federal agencies this week on the transition Trumps team will start getting briefings related to the Defense Department State Department Treasury Department and other agencies These will include budget details flow charts for staff and other information Getty Images 18 White House staffers await Trumps arrival on the steps of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building APAssociated Press 18 The discussions are a symbolic start to the power transition formalised in January APAssociated Press 18 Staffers gather outside the West Wing awaiting President-elect Trumps arrival Officials at those agencies will start speaking regularly to Trump team members to facilitate the handover of power in January The White House also says the Obama administration will host two exercises involving multiple agencies to help familiarise Trumps team with government practices and systems for responding to domestic emergencies;Donald Trump arrives at the White House for power transition talks with outgoing President Barack Obama;https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2159514/donald-trump-arrives-in-washington-ahead-of-power-transition-talks-with-president-barack-obama/;{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'arrives at the White House', u'coderPhraseCount': 3}], u'label': u'what'};{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'today', u'coderPhraseCount': 2, u'parsed': u'2016-11-10'}], u'label': u'when'};{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'Washington', u'coderPhraseCount': 3}, {u'text': u'White House', u'coderPhraseCount': 2}], u'label': u'where'};{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'Donald Trump', u'coderPhraseCount': 3}], u'label': u'who'};{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'for power transition talks with outgoing President Barack Obama', u'coderPhraseCount': 3}], u'label': u'why'}

hospital after a tram believed to have been going too fast crashed in south London on Wednesday morning Survivors of the accident said people went flying as the tram left the tracks with bodies and blood inside the carriages following the derailment which occurred at about 610am Some passengers said the driver of the vehicle who was arrested afterwards had blacked out Martin Bamford 30 from Croydon one of those on the tram recalled it speeding up Everyone just literally went flying he said Speaking outside Croydon University hospital where he was being treated for broken ribs he added It was just terrifying There was a woman that was on top of me I dont think she made it at all She wasnt responsive There was blood everywhere Bamford said he asked the driver if he was OK He said YeahI said to him What happened He said he thinks he blacked out Royal Navy veteran Kevin Snow 57 was one of those injured He said the tram failed to slow down at its usual point coming out of a tunnel between the Lloyd Park and Sandilands stops Usually as you come out the tunnel you feel the brakes but I didnt seem to at all I thought He should be braking in a minute The next thing I knew we were on our side Everyone was screaming and shouting a lot of people were injured - lots couldnt move He said the tram slid for between eight and 10 seconds before coming to a halt It seemed like for ever that everyone was trying to get out but we couldnt find a way out All I could think about was if no one called the emergency services could another tram hit us The Rail Accident Investigation Branch RAIB said Initial indications suggest that the tram was travelling at a significantly higher speed than is permitted British Transport police Asst Ch Con Robin Smith said the force was investigating whether the driver fell asleep alongside a number of factors He said officers would be working through the night at the scene and staff would be present for a number of days He said We have a very difficult and very challenging scene We have carriages that are lying on their side which will eventually have to be moved carefully And at the same time us being able to understand exactly what happened The 42-year-old male driver from Beckenham is being held on suspicion of manslaughter and is currently in custody British Transport police said The crash occurred near to Sandilands junction on a sharp left-hand curve as the tram was approaching a stop as it travelled from New Addington to Wimbledon There is a 12mph 20kmh speed limit on the section in question which is on old rail tracks The Croydon trams have a top speed of around 50mph After news the crash broke claims emerged on Facebook that an incident had occurred on the same stretch of line on 31 October though there were no reports that anyone was hurt In a post written that day Andy Nias from Croydon wrote 30 of us on the tram this morning and we all thought our time was up tram driver took the hard corner to Sandilands at 40mph I swear the tram lifted on to one side Everyone still shaking its mad In a further post on Wednesday Nias said he had reported the incident to British Transport police who advised him not to speak to journalists Another man James Tofield who is also from Croydon said he too was on the tram on 31 October On Wednesday evening he posted an image online of a text message to his partner dated that morning It read The driver went round the bend so fast u no the tunnel when u r coming up to Sandilands hes obviously forgot theres a bend approaching smacked on the brakes and somehow the tram managed to stay on the track He said he intended to report the incident to both Transport for London TfL and the police TfL said it was aware of the claims but refused to comment further because an investigation was ongoing British Transport police did not respond to a request for comment Wednesdays crash is the worst accident on the rail and tram networks since 2004 when seven people were killed in a rail crash near Ufton Nervet in Berkshire when a car driver trying to kill himself caused a serious accident There have been no fatalities on board a tram in the UK since 1959 when two female passengers and the driver died when a tram caught fire in Shettlestone Road Glasgow after a collision with a lorry Martin Harris who was on his way to work called his mother Jane after the crash to tell her a body was lying on top of him She told the Telegraph that he had told her it looked like the driver had fallen asleep Jane Harris added He was on the tram the tram was going really fast the tram went over my son had a dead body on him Nearby resident Hannah Collier 23 said I heard a massive crash at about 615am then heard shouting then the emergency services arrived They started bringing up the casualties some very seriously injured Eight fire engines five fire rescue units containing specialist rescue equipment and 22 ambulance crews were involved in the rescue operation A spokeswoman for the London ambulance service said eight people had serious or life-threatening injuries 20 of those injured were taken to St Georges university hospital in Tooting and 31 to Croydon university hospital Croydon Health Services NHS trust urged members of the public with minor ailments to go to their GP or a walk-in centre instead of the hospital to ease pressure on staff A casualty helpline was set up for relatives and friends to call Mike Brown Londons transport commissioner said Our thoughts are with those who sadly lost their lives in this incident those who were injured and the families of those affected We are working closely with the emergency services on-site and will continue to work with them during the investigation into what happened Finn Brennan of the train drivers union Aslef said the incident was truly dreadful He said Lives have been lost and there are many serious injuries This is a tragedy for all those involved For the women and men who set out this morning on their journey to work and suffered this awful accident and their families the grief and pain must be terrible There should be no rush to judgment or to place blame until the facts are known Transport expert Christian Wolmar who is also Labours candidate in the Richmond Park byelection said trams generally had an excellent safety record and most accidents that did occur involved road vehicles or pedestrians This sort of accident is incredibly rare particularly because its on a section that used to be a railway and there are no cars around he said The Croydon tram is Londons

been getting that tram for nine years and normally you feel it braking there This time I couldnt feel it braking at all I dont know whether the brakes werent working but it was going way too fast But if those carriages had been built with unbreakable glass none of these people would have died When it started sliding down the line on its side anything going through it was like going against a blade

spoken to the driver adding I asked him what happened and he said he thinks he blacked out Another passenger Nathan Evan Gibson 21 said a man next to him was killed when he was thrown through a window as the train careered over Rail engineer Mr Gibson grabbed on to a pole as fellow commuters were thrown in all directions He suffered a cut to his eye and a bang to the head that required a CT scan

simply not going to be his year Despite driving at his brilliant best to win the Brazilian Grand Prix for the first time in his career his title looks destined to be crossing the Mercedes garage floor to Nico Rosberg Getty Images 6 Lewis Hamilton celebrates victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix Getty Images 6 But the World Championship is likely to be Nico Rosbergs in Abu Dhabi Getty Images 6 Romain Grosjeans car was towed after crashing out in the formation lap of a chaotic race Hamilton reigned supreme in the rain-hit incident packed race that saw TWO red flags and FIVE safety cars deployed It was the 52nd victory of his F1 career and moves him to second in the all-time winners list behind Michael Schumacher But the looming figure of Rosberg stood next to him on the podium in second place means the German can win the title with a top-three finish in Abu Dhabi irrespective of where Hamilton finishes Hamiltons third win in a row cannot stop the tide The damage was done early in the season with woeful reliability problems ensuring that it goes down to the final race Nevertheless the Brit has promised to give it his best shot in the desert He said I am hunting and all I can do is do what I can I am going to give it my all in Abu Dhabi I need to keep on doing It is going to be hard to beat Nico but it does not mean I cannot win the race I am going to take this energy and speed and try to push as hard as I can to win that race Getty Images 6 Hamilton was left furious after the race was twice red flagged Rosberg was given a huge helping hand thanks to a Red Bull strategy blunder to pit the swashbuckling Max Verstappen for intermediate tyres The sensational Dutch driver made a string of sensational overtakes that livened up this race but after overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and Rosberg was inexplicably called in for fresh rubber The gambled backfired and a subsequent stop dropped him down to 15th place -- incredibly he battled back to third Hamilton was also left furious after race bosses put the brakes on his charge to the chequered flag on two occasions At one point the Brit had a stonking lead that was almost 26 second over his rival but that was wiped out when the retiring Felipe Massa crashed out forcing out the safety car Getty Images 6 Red Bulls Max Verstappen was the outstanding driver at Interlagos Then there was Race Director Charlie Whitings inexplicable call to stop the race despite a number of drivers including Hamilton calling for him to allow them to race Hamilton vented his frustration over the teams radio towards Whiting -- who was blasted by Ferraris Sebastian Vettel in the last race At the second red flag Hamilton groaned The track is fine It is not even that wet now This is not extreme wet conditions this is normal The spectators at Interlagos also greeted Whitings decision with jeers As it happened Whitings decision made no difference to Hamilton thought it could have forced Rosberg into making a mistake that would have put him out of the race No wonder then that the German was content with second place that leaves him with a 12 point lead in the championship with one to go Lewis Hamilton talks about how good the team at Mercedes are He added It did not go my way Lewis did a great job but I can live with second I was hoping for a win for second is OK Hamiltons win was good but the real star was Verstappen The 19-year-old was belittled by Mercedes boss Toto Wolff last week after he contacted his father Jos to warn him about his son meddling in the title race Yet he answered the criticism perfectly with a thrilling performance including one of the saves of the season impressing Verstappen senior in the process Jos Verstappen said I must say he surprised me today Ive seen many races he did and today it

about made me pass out Zobrist said How to distill it Well maybe with the most Cubs fact of all They held a three-run lead in the bottom of the eighth with four outs to go They had their 100-mph closer on the mound to seal it up And they couldnt do it Suddenly 2016 was going to fit right alongside 2003 and 1984 and all the rest That backstory and the fact that it was 68 years since the Indians last World Series title colored this entire event Theres been a burden placed Cubs Manager Joe Maddon said And I think quite frankly its misplaced I totally respect whats happened in the past and I totally respect our fan base But if you just want to carry the burden with you all the time tonight would never happen 1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x The Chicago Cubs win World

World Series Matt SlocumAP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue It did So clear off the table Spread out the evidence Take a deep breath Lets sort this out The Cubs took what appeared to be control -- a laughable notion in Wrigleyville for sure -- by going up 5-1 in the fifth with all the runs coming off Cleveland ace Corey Kluber and impenetrable reliever Andrew Miller And yet when Maddon went to get starter Kyle Hendricks in the fifth there were potential issues Asked before the game whether he would insert veteran left-handed starter Jon Lester into a situation with men on base Maddon was clear I dont think it would be appropriate he said Lester has an awful time holding base runners on due to an absolute phobia of throwing a baseball -- other than 60 feet 6 inches Yet he entered -- along with David Ross his personal catcher -- with two outs and a man on first in the fifth For the first time things went a bit haywire Not in the Cubs history of course But for the first time Wednesday night Jason Kipnis hit a spinner in front of the plate that Ross misfired to first for an error and Lester uncorked a wild pitch that was so wild it scored two runs Progressive Field filled with plenty of Cubs fans shook with the glee from Clevelands own You dont think about storybooks and stuff like that Cleveland Manger Terry Francona said Youre trying to figure out a way to score one more run When Lester departed with two outs in the eighth he received and deserved congratulations The last of his 55 pitches became an infield single to Jose Ramirez But when Maddon turned to Aroldis Chapman his closer the situation was manageable 6-3 lead one on one out to get in the eighth then three more to get in the ninth People are texting me congrats Epstein said Im like expletive This is baseball Anything can happen So it did Twice in this series Chapman entered in the seventh And as the Cubs crawled back from what had been a 3-1 deficit he was asked to get the final eight outs of Game 5 then four more outs in Tuesdays Game 6 The first hitter he faced was Brandon Guyer and it was clear immediately that Chapmans velocity -- his defining quality -- was down I think if youre being honest I feel like the entirety of the playoffs probably did take its toll on him Cubs General Manager Jed Hoyer I think that hes probably tired as he should be End of Cubs championship drought brings forth a mighty sound Normally the hardest thrower in the game with a fastball that averages more than 100 mph Chapman settled in immediately at 97 mph Hard to deal with for sure But not his overwhelming self So Guyer cranked a double to right-center that scored a run Cleveland all but shook as Rajai Davis came to the plate Davis in the lineup for his defense had gained confidence against Chapman earlier in the series I just felt like this was going to be a fight he said that I was going to win Chapman fed Davis nothing but four-seam fastballs He missed with two out of the zone but there was a telling development the four that were strikes Davis didnt swing and miss He fouled them off He was battling Montero said of Chapman With the count 2-2 Chapman came with his seventh straight fastball this one at 97 mph Davis jumped on it It wasnt majestic Just historic It went into the corner in left field near the foul pole When it cleared the wall the Indians spilled out of their dugout like Little Leaguers Tie game Just ecstatic Shaw said And then at the end of the ninth the skies opened up The tarp came out I really feel like in some ways that rain delay was kind of divine intervention Hoyer said The game was going really fast for us at that point Epstein and Hoyer went under the stands to meet with officials from Major League Baseball about the plan and the weather They then slipped into the Cubs clubhouse where the hitters who were due up the next inning were meeting Cubs had a great night Bill Murrays was better I got a little concerned Epstein said He cracked open the door Right fielder Jason Heyward -- he of the 184 million contract and the 200 postseason batting average -- had called the guys together Ive got something to say Zobrist recalled Heyward saying And he talked about this epic game and this epic team He told them they would win We just needed a brief moment to kind of collect ourselves and be reminded of who we are Heyward said And who they were about to become In the 10th Zobrist came up with two on and one out against Shaw Maddon believes Zobrist consistently delivers the Cubs best at-bats Here he fouled off one 1-2 cutter from Shaw He didnt miss the next sending it into left field scoring Almora with the run that put them up 7-6 Turns out they needed Monteros RBI single too because Davis somehow managed to push one across for the Indians in the bottom of the 10th I died like six times Epstein said So start the conversation Where does this Game 7 fit all-time Debate it Thursday over the weekend for 108 years Epstein considered it after 2 am standing on the mound at Progressive Field where he had just taken a picture with the front office he runs Rain poured down and he looked up into it Everyones prone to hyperbole on nights like tonight he said But it is kind of epic right Routine three-run victories dont change life There is now what we knew before 1247 am Thursday and the unknown afterward Welcome

New York Times Hillary Clinton pictured after giving her concession speech has blamed FBI Director James Comey for her election defeat The new examination was sparked by an unrelated investigation

to a 15-year-old girl The emails in question were found on Weiners laptop Clinton told the donors that her campaign was leading by large margins in nearly every battleground state and was tied in

believed were on the fence until Comeys announcement pushed them onto Team Trump White women voted for Trump in surprising numbers and were a major factor in deciding several of the key swing states that put Trump in the White House Clintons campaign said white women were swayed to vote Trump by Comeys letter which potentially decided the election Significantly more white women voted for Donald Trump than expected Pictured are a group of women at a rally on Monday in North Carolina ANTHONY WEINER SEXTING SCANDAL The FBI the New York Police Department and US attorneys in New York and North Carolina opened investigations into Weiners conduct in late September after DailyMailcom exclusively reported on Sept 21 that the former politician carried on a months-long online relationship with a 15-year-old high school girl Weiner exchanged flirtatious and sexually-charged messages with the teen for months after the girl struck up a conversation with him on Twitter in January Weiner told the girl he woke up hard after thinking about her sent her shirtless photos and complimented her body He also encouraged her to talk to him on the video-chat application Skype The girl alleged that during these Skype conversations Weiner asked her to get undressed and touch herself She claimed he also asked her to dress up in school girl outfits and pretend he was her teacher and brought up rape fantasies Weiner issued a statement to the Dailymailcom apologizing for repeatedly demonstrateing terrible judgment about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent In one particularly lewd message he told the teen I would bust that tight py so hard and so often that you would leak and limp for a week Trumps campaign and Republican supporters seized on the news even though it was unclear whether Clintons correspondence was tied up in the probe Comey told lawmakers the Sunday before the election that the bureau had found no evidence to warrant criminal charges His all clear message only served to further motivate Trump supporters Clinton told donors on the call In the nine days between Comeys initial statement and his all clear announcement nearly 24 million people cast early ballots That was roughly 18 percent of the expected total votes for president While Clinton accepted some blame of her loss according to donors who listened to her call she made little mention of the other factors driving Trumps victory A desire for change by voters possible sexism the difficulty of a political party winning a third White House term her campaigns all-but-dismissal of white working class voters and flaws within her own message Democrats have spent much of this week reeling for their loss with many in the party beginning a process of soul-searching designed to sort out what exactly went wrong Liberals like Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren say Democrats must embrace a more aggressive economic message -- one Clinton largely shied away from during her campaign Clintons blaming of Comey echoes what her aides have said in the days since the election Clinton told the donors that her campaign was leading by large margins in nearly every battleground state prior to the Comey letter About 24 million people early voted in the days between when Comey announced the investigation had been reopened and when it was again closed We believe that we lost this election in the last week Comeys letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters--particularly in the suburbs Navin Nayak head of Clintons opinion research division wrote in a letter obtained by Politico We also think Comeys 2nd letter which was intended to absolve Sec Clinton actually helped to bolster Trumps turnout Weiner conduct came under investigation in late September after DailyMailcom exclusively reported on Sept 21 that the former politician carried on a months-long online relationship with a 15-year-old high school girl An investigation into Anthony Weiners explicit messages with a 15-year-old girl

by 290 votes to 228 with Michigan and New Hampshire yet to declare - in the electoral college that decides the presidency An individual who was on the donors call Politico reported claimed Clinton said the first letter prompted a fall in favourable polling but there was a rebound before the second letter awakened Donald Trumps voters The New York Times quoted a donor as saying Clinton said There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful our analysis is that Comeys letter raising doubts that were groundless baseless proven to be stopped our momentum The comments which were similar to reported remarks by other campaign sources contrasted with anger from Javier Palomarez president and chief executive of the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce USHCC He told the Guardian on Saturday it was Clintons neglect of Latino voters that handed the presidency to Trump Comey made headlines on 28 October with his first letter 11 days before the vote In the letter he told members of Congress that new emails had been discovered that could be relevant to a completed investigation into Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state The original investigation had ended in July with no charge against Clinton who Comey said had been extremely careless in her conduct but not to the extent of criminal or intentional wrongdoing The new emails were discovered it was reported on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin during an investigation into Weiner for for allegedly exchanging lewd messages with a minor Republicans responded with bafflement at Comeys break with policy and decades of precedent and furious senior Democrats suggested the FBI director may have violated the Hatch Act a federal statute that bars political activity by senior officials Comeys second letter was sent last Sunday two days before the election In it he said a review of the newly discovered emails had been completed and that it found no evidence to merit reopening the investigation of Clinton Republicans including Trump responded angrily alleging that the review could not have been completed correctly in so short a time Reports said 650000 emails were in question although that number was not officially confirmed Saturdays reported remarks mirrored comments previously reported by Politico in an email from Navin Nayak Clintons head of opinion research We believe that we lost this election in the last week the magazine reported Nayak as writing on Thursday Comeys letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters -

WASHINGTON -- President Obama said he and successor-in-waiting Donald Trump had an excellent conversation Thursday as the intense rivals who defined the volatile 2016 election discussed the hand-off of the White House Just days after vicious attacks on the campaign trail the two men spoke well of each other and shook hands for the cameras Trump who famously challenged the presidents place of birth called his predecessor a very good man following their Oval Office meeting Obama said his number one priority in the next two months in office is to facilitate the transition to the Trump administration He said the two talked about organizational issues as well as domestic and foreign policies I believe that it is important for all of us regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together work together to deal with the many challenges that we face Obama told reporters In pledging a smooth transition Obama told Trump that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed -- because if you succeed then the country succeeds Trump -- noting that the meeting ran long -- said Mr President it was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many many more times in the future The New York businessman also said We had never met each other I have great respect The two shook hands for the cameras but did not take questions from reporters Heading into the meeting Obama and Trump struck conciliatory notes in the wake of Tuesdays surprising election results following a campaign of searing rhetoric Its time for America to bind the wounds of division Trump said during his victory speech early Wednesday Obama is quite sincere about fulfilling the basic responsibility that he has to the American people and our democracy to ensure a smooth transition to the next presidency said White House press secretary Josh Earnest After the meeting Earnest said the two leaders did not resolve all of their differences but did not try to either their focus was a smooth transition Trump followed up the meeting by heading to Capitol Hill to meet with another key player in his emerging presidency Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan The vice president-elect Mike Pence also attended the session with Ryan who like Obama has had his share of differences with Trump Afterward Ryan said that we had a fantastic productive meeting about getting to work The president-elect also met with another powerful Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky President-elect Donald Trump wife Melania and Vice

Obama and Trump spoke in the Oval Office first lady Michelle Obama gave a tour of the residence to Melania Trump During the campaign Mrs Obama criticized Trump over his lewd comments about women Mrs Trump during her address to the Republican national convention used lines cribbed from a speech the first lady had once given In preparing for his sit-down with Trump the president said it is no secret that they have some pretty significant differences But the president added that hed also had differences with his predecessor George W Bush and they had a smooth transition He said he has instructed aides to follow the example that President Bushs team set eight years ago and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the president-elect People gather

Gingrich described the meeting between the president and his successor as an amazing tribute to the power of the people Trump spent much of his insurgent campaign pledging to reverse and tear down Obamas legacy He called for repealing and replacing the presidents health care law voiding the Iran nuclear deal and ripping up new business and environmental regulations On the stump Trump also criticized Obama for campaigning so much on behalf of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton saying he should do the job hes supposed to be doing In his campaign speeches Obama cast Trump as an erratic and perhaps unstable political novice who shouldnt be allowed near the nuclear codes Its really bad being arrogant when you dont know what youre talking about Obama said The Obama-Trump rivalry intrinsic to the 2016 election goes back years During Obamas first term Trump made a name for himself by becoming the de facto leader of the so-called birther movement pushing the false idea that the president was not born in the United States In this past campaign year Clinton described the birther movement as a racist attack on the nations first African-American president In 2011 Obama responded

delay to clinch the World Series One of the greatest sports stories can now be written At long last the Chicago Cubs are champions of the baseball world At 0048 in Cleveland Ohio Michael Martinez of the hometown Indians chopped a groundball to third base There Kris Bryant scooped it up and fired across the diamond to Anthony Rizzo When the ball landed in his glove the World Series was over So too was the Cubs 108-year wait for a title as a dream held by millions across numerous generations became reality The Cubs without a title since 1908 played seven exhilarating games against the Indians who last won a championship in 1948 When combined their droughts spanned 176 years No other franchise had endured a longer wait but there could only be one winner Many thought this day would never arrive A powerhouse of baseballs formative years the Cubs played in three of the first five World Series triumphing in 1907 and 1908 But then came a huge reversal of fortune as fans endured over a century of failure often in the most painful ways imaginable Between 1910 and 1945 the Cubs won seven National League pennants but lost each time in the World Series Media playback is not supported on this device Chicago Cubs fans go wild after World Series win The drought was imbued with fresh intrigue in 1945 when a local tavern owner supposedly put a curse on the franchise William Sianis proprietor of the Billy Goat Tavern took a goat to certain games at Wrigley Field but he and his pet were refused admission to a World Series contest against the Detroit Tigers that year According to legend Sianis was so outraged he proclaimed the Cubs would never win another World Series Surviving relatives say he even sent a telegram with such a declaration to team owner PK Wrigley Sianis didnt have omnipotent baseball powers but the Cubs championship drought continued long after his death in 1970 In fact it became the longest fallow period in the history of North American sports as the Cubs waited 71 years for a World Series return let alone a title Along the way several ghoulish incidents were attributed to the curse such as an epic collapse in 1969 and a crucial groundball rolling through the legs of first baseman Leon Durham in a 1984 play-off game Then there was Steve Bartman a loyal fan who tangled with outfielder Moises Alou as he pursued a foul ball late in the sixth game of the 2003 National League Championship Series NLCS Up 3-0 the Cubs were five defensive outs away from returning to the World Series but Alous path to the ball was blocked and the Florida Marlins then scored eight unanswered runs before clinching the pennant in Game Seven Theo Epstein was tasked with reversing this sorry narrative and finally bringing a world title to the North Side Among the best executives in baseball Epstein masterminded two World Series triumphs as general manager of the Red Sox Boston had a storied championship drought of its own from 1918 until 2004 Epstein built a juggernaut and secured a further title in 2007 before Cubs owner Tom Ricketts hired him as president of baseball operations in 2011 Chicago Cubs leftfielder Ben Zobrist was named most valuable player of the World Series It was the second consecutive year he has won the World Series after helping the Kansas City Royals to victory last season Jed Hoyer one of Epsteins disciples was appointed general manager while player development expert Jason McLeod also joined the revolution With smart use of cutting edge analytics and mastery of traditional scouting they slowly changed the culture in Chicago The Cubs finished last in each of their first four seasons losing 94 out of 162 games per year on average Yet much of that was by design as Epstein and his vaunted front office looked to take advantage of rules regarding baseballs amateur draft Each year teams pick new players from high school or university with the order of that selection process determined by win-loss record The worse a team performs the greater its chances of drafting a future superstar Young players are also paid much less than veterans initially affording teams far more flexibility on their payroll This may seem like a perverse incentive to lose but the Cubs used this strategy to replenish their organisation with elite young talent Bryant won Rookie of the Year in 2015 before hitting 39 home runs this season He formed a potent partnership with Rizzo who has matured into a perennial candidate for the Most Valuable Player award Other young stars on the team include flashy infielder Javy Baez powerful slugger Schwarber and lithe shortstop Russell Media playback is not supported on this device Is Chicago Cubs Billy Goat Curse finally over To direct this talented group Epstein lured well-respected manager Joe Maddon from Tampa Bay and Chicago finally secured another NLCS berth under his influence in 2015 The New York Mets were too strong but it was a huge step in the right direction for a team of apparent destiny After adding veteran talent during the winter Chicago finished with a 103-58 record this season good enough to secure their first division title since 2008 The Cubs then beat San Francisco and Los Angeles in successive post-season rounds to clinch a trip back to the World Series There they faced the Indians owners of baseballs second-longest championship drought The last time Cleveland won a title Jackie Robinson was just a year removed from integrating the Major Leagues This clash of fates made for spectacular viewing as two tortured fanbases dreamed and winced with every swing in momentum Cleveland won game one 6-0 thanks to the dominant pitching of Corey Kluber and a big home run from catcher Roberto Perez The Cubs rebounded to even the series with a 5-1 win before Coco Crisp provided a huge pinch-hit run-scoring single to win the third game for Cleveland 1-0 The Indians also took game four a 7-2 win edging them within one victory of the Promised Land Just as people began to question the Cubs they embarked on a magical winning streak A Bryant home run sparked a big rally to win game five 3-2 and back at Progressive Field for game six Chicago took advantage of a pivotal fielding misplay to score three runs in the first inning A grand slam home run by Russell opened the floodgates and game seven was confirmed as the Cubs ran out 9-3 victors The deciding contest had innumerable twists and displayed extremes of raw emotion that will never be forgotten Chicago fans take to the streets to celebrate the Chicago Cubs victory after an 108 year wait When Rizzo squeezed the final ball in his mitt wild celebrations engulfed the field Players collapsed in a heap of collective happiness before the golden trophy was presented There was no trophy back in 1908 There were no mobile phones or internet no radio or television no mass-produced cars or even sliced bread That underscores the magnitude of this moment This was a victory for the dedicated fans who had waited 39467 days between championships It was a victory for all those great players who never experienced success with the Cubs from Hack Wilson and Ernie Banks to Ron Santo and Sammy Sosa It was a victory that will motivate people to place Cubs caps on the gravestones of bygone loved ones and celebrate with those who shared this journey It was a victory for Epstein who has all but secured a place in the Hall of Fame It was a victory for Zobrist who was crowned World Series MVP And yes it was a victory for Steve Bartman who can now enjoy a normal life Theres no way to describe how we feel right now said Maddon It frees everybody up and the trajectory of this organisation really sets us up for many years to come Thats for another day Right now its time to celebrate in Chicago They finally did it and baseball will never be the same again;Chicago Cubs win World Series Baseball will never be the same again;http://www.bbc.com/sport/baseball/37857919;{u'annotated': [{u'text': u'win

won the World Series Jenny StarrsThe Washington Post The streets of Chicago were flooded with fans after the Cubs won the World Series Jenny StarrsThe Washington Post The Chicago Cubs won the World Series here Wednesday night for the young the old and the long dead too Of course these Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians 8-7 in 10 thrilling brain-warping innings in Game 7 for themselves for their own joy and glory But as they have been reminded endless times in the past seven months of this baseball season they also won the Cubs first title since 1908 for the citizens of a nation without borders They lifted the silly curse of Murphy the Goat and roused the spirits of a worldwide legion of interwoven sufferers who share a passion and an affliction -- a lifelong freely chosen Cubness Because this game went beyond the baseball surreal because it provided forgetfulness and forgiveness for several Cubs who might have been enormous goats including reliever Aroldis Chapman and Manager Joe Maddon it seemed to encapsulate the teams long history of staring into the abyss Only this time at long last -- it only took a century or so -- the abyss blinked Believe it Chicago Cubs win classic Game 7 to win first World Series since 1908 With a 6-3 lead and just four outs required to clinch this series the Cubs brought on Chapman who earlier this year threw a 105-mph fastball Cubs fans all over the world thought they knew what would happen when he entered with a man on first base and two outs in the eighth He would slam the door on the Indians and extend Clevelands own World Series drought which dates from 1948 Hint Dewey did not defeat Truman that year Editors note A previous version of this video incorrectly stated that Satchel Paige was the first African American player in the American League Cleveland outfielder Larry Doby was the first Paige was the first black pitcher to throw in a World Series Gillian BrockellThe Washington Post So much for assumptions With two of the most unexpected swings in World Series history the baseball worlds of these two cities flipped Obscure Brandon Guyer smashed an RBI double off the center field wall on a 979-mph fastball Then on the seventh pitch of his at-bat 35-year-old journeyman Rajai Davis launched a two-run homer into left on a 971-mph fastball His blast fair by less than 10 feet and a few rows deep into the bleachers might as well have traveled 600 feet -- and the score was 6-6 For 108 years this is when the curse arrives and gags the life out of the choking Cubs But finally not this time Chapman finished the eighth then he pitched a scoreless ninth to send the game into extra innings Next it rained Honest For a 17-minute rain delay Was that the baseball gods idea of an appropriate amount of time for prayer begging and unspeakable promises to all available deities When the tarp was removed the sun rose on the Cubs even though it was past midnight Kyle Schwarber greeted losing pitcher Bryan Shaw with a single Soon World Series MVP Ben Zobrist had sliced a double into the left field corner to break the tie then Miguel Montero singled home an insurance run Finally in the 10th inning reliever Carl Edwards Jr who had dressed as Mr Incredible on a Cubs Halloween plane ride tried to get the save He allowed one run but Mike Montgomery finally put out the blaze -- the largest perhaps in the view of Chicagoans since Mrs OLearys barn had that little accident in 1871 At 1247 am after 4 hours 28 minutes the mound mob scene began Just a guess It was better than the one in 1908 The Cubs had a great night Bill Murrays was better The happiest Cub may have been Maddon who in the view of many -- okay almost the whole baseball universe -- had overused Chapman unnecessarily in Game 6 allowing him to pitch in all or parts of the seventh eighth and ninth innings even though he had already gotten an eight-out save the longest of his career in Game 5 Now all that will be forgiven though

seemed jammed with Cubs symbolism When Dexter Fowler hit the third pitch of the game over the center field fence then danced backward between first and second base exhorting his teammates he was by his spontaneous jubilation honoring so many great Cubs of the past who never played in a single World Series game like the late Ernie Banks Mr Cub When Javier Baez and David Ross 39 playing his last game also hit solo homers perhaps they were not just high-fiving teammates as they returned to the jumping Cubs dugout but also saluting a long tradition of baseball affection on the North Side of Chicago that is so powerful and authentic that it has withstood a century of frustration while keeping alive a powerful multigenerational baseball love affair How fitting after all of this that the Cubs would become the first team since 1985 to have the fortitude to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a World Series And the first since 1979 to win the final two games on the road How ironic -- but suitably sweet -- that the 2016 Cubs will be known for playoff grit in all three rounds of this postseason In their division series they trailed San Francisco 5-2 in the ninth inning of Game 4 and seemed certain to face scary Johnny Cueto in a decisive fifth game Yet they scored four in the ninth to kill the Giants The Dodgers shut them out back-to-back to take a 2-1 lead in the National League Championship Series Then with their first pennant since 1945 at stake the Cubs stomped Los Angeles flat winning three straight games by a combined score of 23-6 No one season erases a century of lousy teams bad management and a half-dozen famous choke jobs including defeats in the NLCS in 1984 and 2003 when the Cubs held three-run leads but lost and did it with haunting misplays whether by first baseman Leon Durham or one of their own fans But this season with its balm and blessings aplenty will have to serve -- and considering the style with which this whole affair was completed including three relief innings by ace Jon Lester -- it should more than suffice From now on wherever two or three Cubs fans are gathered together and still wonder smacking their foreheads how Jose Cardenal once missed a game because his eyelids were stuck together there will be joy and relief whenever Nov 2 2016 is recalled And there will be amazement too that they were resilient and hopeful for so long -- and perhaps just a touch dopey for sticking with Americas biggest bunch of baseball losers Poor Cleveland Now it is the leader in frustration without a World Series title since 1948 Unless of course you count a city rather than a continuous one-town franchise in the futility calculation Then Washington with no such celebration since 1924 takes the bitter prize Five things to remember about the Cubs memorable victory Perhaps there has never been a World Series in which there was as much or perhaps more focus on the fans of the two teams both living and long departed In the past 40 years there has certainly never been a World Series crowd so divided in loyalty The cause Enormous numbers of Cubs fans paid huge prices for tickets on the secondary market Some if they risked buying from scalpers who might have bogus tickets got bargains as low as 1200 But one pair of tickets behind the Cubs dugout was sold on StubHub for 23000 -- apiece Cubs fans might have more money than us Indians Manager Terry Francona conceded Among the reveling Cubs fans was Kevin OBrien a Chicago lawyer wearing a vintage Bruce Sutter jersey If you count from birth which I do Ive been a Cubs fan for 55 years he said My moms 82 and shes been a Cubs fan all her life too She used to clean the Wrigley Field bleachers after games in the 40s and 50s to get free tickets to the next game So I was stuck The whole family are Cubs fans -- brothers sisters cousins said OBrien who was asked how much he had paid for his ticket since he was in a sense representing all branches of his family Too much Not going to say he said But my wife is happy it was less than her engagement ring 26 years ago When the Cubs fell behind 3-1 in this series some Cubs fans simply hoped this series would be extended back to Cleveland for a sixth game so that they could glimpse their team in a World Series for the first time since 1945 even if the Cubs ultimately lost In Wrigley Field tickets were 3000 4000 or 5000 I live there and I couldnt get into my own park said Eddie Opitz 58 a truck driver from Mt Prospect Ill who found a much cheaper ticket here for the Cubs victory in Game 6 I called my wife this morning Last week was our 25th wedding anniversary She said So youre coming home today right I said Errrrrr I wish it wasnt Cleveland we had to beat What theyve gone through all these years is so much like us Opitz said long before that final winning pitch Wish it couldve been the Yankees But after 108 years the Cubs and their fans have come to a decision They wont be picky They will just take this World Series -- and its incredible final Game 7 -- in their loving arms and toddle off into a long and blissful winter;You knew it couldnt come easily but the Cubs are World Series

message as we move forward in this new time He declined to comment on the possibility of burying the hatchet with Trump and joining his administration I expect Ill be governor of Ohio for the next two years he said The high-profile meeting between Obama and his successor set the White House into a frenzy on Thursday Staffers continued to mourn what could have been under a President Clinton as they turned their focus to the impending transition For the first time in eight years the country will have a new president on January 20 and he will come from the opposing political party Waving goodbye Airport workers waved and took photographs of the departing president-elects plane as it made the short journey to Washington On the move The president-elect was in a full Secret Service protective motorcade for the first time Mogul is heading to Washington POTUS-elect Trump was in a Secret Service armored SUV for the trip to La Guardia airport Ambulance too The use of an emergency medical vehicle in the motorcade puts President-elect Trumps protection at the same level as Obamas Welomce President Obamas meeting is the symbolic start of the transition of power In anticipation of a Clinton win White House aides seemingly made no plans to hand over the keys Trump Theres no specific thing that I have in mind that were going to do differently now White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said after he was asked by a reporter if the administration was building a firewall to protect Obama-era policies Earnest said Wednesday Our plan all along was to ensure the successful implementation of those and other priorities and were going to be committed to doing everything we can to ensure the success of those policies between now and January 20th Today Earnest said the administration would have the same priorities in its last two months in office as it would have regardless of the outcome of the election Whether or not Mr Trump had emerged victorious from the election we would be focused on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and maximizing the opportunity that currently is available to millions of Americans to go to healthcaregov during the open enrollment period and sign up for health care he said Trump has said he will dismantle the Democratic presidents health care law deport the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country negotiate the 12-nation trade deal brokered by the Obama administration and remand the nuclear agreement with Iran Previewing the meeting today between the president and the president-elect Earnest said yesterday that Obama would talk to Trump about some of these policies and about some of the benefits of some of these policies The President-elects team will have an opportunity to get briefed by the national security experts here in the Obama administration that have been working on implementing these policies But ultimately the President-elect will be the person that is responsible for setting the path of foreign policy for the United States for the next four years Earnest said Earnest was tight-lipped Thursday about the president and the president-elects discussion Im not going to get into all of the details of their meeting he said The anticipated show of civility at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue contrasted with post-election scenes of protests across a politically divided country Demonstrators from New England to the heartland and the West Coast vented against the election winner on Wednesday chanting Not my president burning a papier-mache Trump head beating a Trump pinata and carrying signs that said Impeach Trump Republicans were emboldened by Trumps stunning victory over Hillary Clinton giving the GOP control of the White House and both chambers of Congress He just earned a mandate Ryan said Trump and Obamas meeting is a far cry from how former president George W Bush and his wife Laura greeted the Obamas in November 2008 When the Bushes met with the Obamas shortly after Barack Obama was elected president George Bush opened their meeting to the press and waiting outside for them to arrive George W and Laura Bush met with Barack and Michelle Obama on November 11 2008 days after Obama had been elected the next president While Trump and Obama are meeting in private and having a photo session afterward the Bush family opened the meeting to the media from the start Obama and Bush chatted as they walked through the colonnade at the White House during their meeting eight years ago In an emotional concession speech Clinton said her crushing loss was painful and it will be for a long time and acknowledged that the nation was more divided than we thought Still Clinton was gracious in defeat declaring Donald Trump is going to be our president We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead Trump was uncharacteristically quiet in the aftermath of his triumph and made no public appearances Wednesday He huddled with jubilant sleep-deprived advisers at his eponymous skyscraper in Manhattan beginning the daunting task of setting up an administration that will take power in just over two months He also met with Pence and took calls from supporters family and friends according to spokeswoman Hope Hicks In Washington Trumps scant transition team sprang into action culling through personnel lists for top jobs and working through handover plans for government agencies A person familiar with the transition operations said the personnel process was still in its early stages but Trumps team was putting a premium on quickly filling key national security posts The person was not authorized to discuss details by name and spoke on condition of anonymity According to an organizational chart for the transition obtained by The Associated Press Trump was relying on experienced hands to help form his administration National security planning was being led by former Michigan Rep Mike Rogers who previously worked for the FBI Domestic issues were being handled by Ken Blackwell a former Cincinnati mayor and Ohio secretary of state Trump was expected to consider several loyal supporters for top jobs including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani for attorney general or national security adviser and campaign finance chairman Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary Waiting Trump was being greeted at Reagan National Airport in Arlington

Trump in the White House while their husbands talk in the Oval Office First lady-in-waiting Melania Trump will have talks with the current First Lady about life in the East Wing Getting ready for Trump power The White House surroundings are now under construction in preparation for the inauguration in January On his way The massive effort to get ready for President Trump is not just inside the West Wing and Oval Office - it is outside in the public areas around the White House Yuge effort The scale of construction works needed for the inauguration means that like transition they begin now Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Tennessee Sen Bob Corker were also expected to be under consideration for foreign policy posts As president-elect Trump is entitled to get the same daily intelligence briefing as Obama - one that includes information on US covert operations information gleaned about world leaders and other data gathered by Americas 17 intelligence agencies The White House said it would organize two exercises involving multiple agencies to help Trumps team learn how to respond to major domestic incidents Its unclear whether Trump will embrace many of the traditions of the presidency Hell enter the White House owning his own private jet as well as a hotel just blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue He never allowed journalists to fly on his plane during the campaign as is customary for White House nominees Issues of transparency bubbled up right from the start On Wednesday evening Trump aides said they would not bring the press corps to Washington with the president-elect for his meeting with Obama breaking long-standing protocol Trump is heading back to New York this evening with his advisers The White House says there are no additional meetings on the books between the two presidents despite Trumps claim that there would be many more to come Massive police presence This was the scene around Trump Tower in New York late on Wednesday

change the look of the bars or raise the price A Toblerone spokeswoman said Like many other companies unfortunately we are experiencing higher costs for many ingredients We carry these costs for as long as possible but to ensure Toblerone remains on shelf is affordable and retains the iconic shape we all know and love we have had to reduce the weight of this particular bar The 150g bar is part

difference between the old and new Toblerone chocolate bars They added Like all food manufacturers we sometimes have to make changes to ensure that people can continue to buy their favourite chocolate

thing to do You buy a bar expecting a normal bar and it looks like you are getting half the chocolate Cathy White added It looks dreadful Think you shouldve reduced the length and kept the chunky triangles Theres also been a huge reaction on Twitter under the Toblerone with some even blaming the change on Brexit A spokeswoman for Mondelez which also owns Cadbury acknowledged that the foreign

email server have not changed our conclusion that she committed no criminal wrongdoing FBI director James Comey told congressional leaders in a letter on Sunday FBI directors troubles just beginning after latest twist in Clinton email tale Read more As campaigning continued ahead of Tuesdays presidential election a Clinton spokeswoman said the candidate was glad this matter is resolved The Democratic nominees opponent Donald Trump reacted with anger at the news and cast doubt on whether the FBI had even carried out its work You cant review 650000 emails in eight days Donald Trump told a campaign rally in Sterling Heights Michigan on Sunday evening On 28 October only 11 days before the presidential election Comey sent congressional leaders a letter informing them that agents had discovered emails that appear pertinent to a prior investigation into Clintons use of a private server while she was secretary of state It was later reported that as many as 650000 such emails were in question The move so close to an election proved tremendously controversial In July Comey had announced that Clinton and her aides were extremely careless but that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against them Since my letter the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation Comey wrote to Congress on Sunday During that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state Based on our review we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton he concluded I am grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time Clinton was onboard her campaign plane when the news broke as she had been when Comey delivered his first letter nine days earlier As news broke aides huddled toward the front of the plane reading from an iPad and spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri entered Clintons cabin shielded by a curtain moments before she spoke to the press We are glad to see that Comey has found as we were confident he would that he has confirmed the conclusions that he reached in July and we are glad that this matter is resolved she told reporters Hillary Clinton retains edge over Donald Trump in elections final sprint Read more Leaving the plane in Cleveland roughly 30 minutes after Comeys announcement Clinton did not respond to a reporters question about whether she had seen the letter When the letter was released Trump was speaking in an airplane hangar in Minneapolis but did not mention the letter to the crowd instead directing his anger against his Democratic rival In Michigan however he said You cant review 650000 emails in eight days Hillary Clinton is guilty She knows it The FBI knows it the people know it and now it is up for American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on 8 November The Republican nominee also insisted that despite Comeys actions the rank and file special agents at the FBI wont let her get away with her terrible crimes including the deletion of 33000 emails after receiving a federal subpoena Trump seemed to be alluding to leaks from within the bureau that revealed acrimony and political rifts within the FBI after Department of Justice officials expressed surprise that Comey would break with decades of tradition regarding investigations and elections Other leading Republicans tried to dismiss the FBIs new conclusion Some things havent changed at all What FBI director Comey said on 7 July under oath to Congress is still the same that she was reckless and careless in her handling of information Trumps campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC The reason that so many Americans have a problem with Hillary Clintons honesty and trustworthiness and veracity does not change Republican House speaker Paul Ryan also insisted that the new conclusion should not change any opinions about Clinton Regardless of this decision the undisputed finding of the FBIs investigation is that Secretary Clinton put our nations secrets at risk and in doing so compromised our national security he said in a statement She simply believes shes above the law and always plays by her own rules End this misogynistic horror show Put Hillary Clinton in the White House Barbara Kingsolver Read more Although Ryan has endured spats with Trump for months he urged Americans to vote for the businessman as he did last week Fortunately the American people have the opportunity to ensure Secretary Clinton never gets her hands on classified information again Ryan said Lets bring the Clinton era to an end by voting for

is under investigation for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit messages with a minor Comeys first letter surprised both campaigns and cast the FBI into the middle of an bitter and volatile race Senior Democrats accused Comey of political meddling Clinton said she found the letter deeply troubling and Trump gleefully predicted the emails would reveal a corruption scandal bigger than Watergate On Sunday Adam Schiff the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee said Comeys letter should end once and for all accusations that Clinton had committed any crime While the original letter should never have been sent so close to an election Schiff said the expeditious review of these emails should put to rest the irresponsible speculation indulged in by the Trump campaign and others The

u'label': u'how'};text/xml;nytimes-3;true;nytimes;Her campaign said the seemingly positive outcome had only hurt it with voters who did not trust Mrs Clinton and were receptive to Mr Trumps claims of a rigged system In particular white suburban women who had been on the fence were reminded of the email imbroglio and broke decidedly in Mr Trumps favor aides said After leading in polls in many battleground states Mrs Clinton told the donors on Saturday we dropped and we had to keep really pushing to regain our advantage which going into last weekend we had We were once again up in all but two of the battleground states and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing Mrs Clinton said And we were feeling like we had to put it back together Presidential candidates have a long history of blaming forces outside their control for their losses In 2004 John Kerry linked his defeat to a videotape of Osama bin Laden that appeared days before the election stoking fears about terrorism In 2012 Mitt Romney told donors he had lost because President Obama had vowed to bestow gifts on Democratic special interests groups namely African-Americans Hispanics and young people Mrs Clintons contention appears to be more rooted in reality -- and hard data An internal campaign memo with polling data said that there is no question that a week from Election Day Secretary Clinton was poised for a historic win but that in the end late-breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome Mrs Clinton lost narrowly in several battleground states and by the time all ballots are counted she appears poised to win the popular vote by more than two million votes Still Mrs Clintons instinct to shun any personal responsibility angered some Democrats Several donors on the call while deeply bitter about Mr Comeys actions said they believed that Mrs Clinton and her campaign had suffered avoidable missteps that handed the election to an unacceptable opponent They pointed to the campaigns lack of a compelling message for white working-class voters and to decisions years ago by Mrs Clinton to use a private email address at the State Department and to accept millions of dollars for speeches to Wall Street There is a special place in hell for Clinton staff allegedly including Cheryl Mills that okayed the email server setup Jim Manley a Democratic strategist and former senior aide to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada wrote on Sidewire a social media site referring to a longtime aide and lawyer to Mrs Clinton Mrs Clintons campaign was so confident in her victory that her aides popped open Champagne on the campaign plane early Tuesday But that conviction aides would later learn was based largely on erroneous data showing that young black and Latino voters and suburban women who had been turned off by Mr Trumps comments but viewed Mrs Clinton unfavorably would turn out for her in higher numbers than they ultimately did Exit polls conducted by Edison Research found that among people who said they had decided in the final week before Election Day 47 percent voted for Mr Trump and 42 percent for Mrs Clinton As early as Wednesday morning aides began to explain to Democrats shaken by the loss that the campaigns sophisticated data modeling had not taken into account the bombshell FBI announcement Mr Comeys letters to Congress went against the FBIs longstanding tradition of avoiding decisions that could affect elections but he told aides that he felt he had no choice because he had already weighed in on the case so publicly In July he had taken the unusual step of publicly announcing that the FBI would not charge Mrs Clinton At the time she believed she had finally put the issue to rest And after the final debate on Oct 19 in Las Vegas she emerged in such a strong position that she began to focus on campaigning for down-ballot Democrats and planned a campaign stop in traditionally Republican Arizona We felt so good about where we were Mrs Clinton told donors Before Mr Comeys first letter to Congress she added we just had a real wind at our back Mr Trump seized on the letter telling voters in Nevada the Saturday before Election Day that the FBI has reopened its criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton and that the matter would grind government to a halt should Mrs Clinton win the White House The FBIs examination of the new emails did not in fact reopen the investigation Democratic pollsters attributed Mr Trumps laser-thin victories in Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin -- states that President Obama had won -- largely to a drifting of college-educated suburban women to the Republican nominee at the last minute because of the renewed focus on Mrs Clintons email server We lost with college-educated whites after leading with them all summer a Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said on Wednesday Five more days of reminders about Comey and they gravitated back to Trump Before Mrs Clinton spoke on Saturday her finance director Dennis Cheng thanked the donors on the call each of whom had raised at least 100000 The campaign brought in nearly 1 billion to spend heavily on data efforts to disperse hundreds of staff members to battleground states and to air television advertisements -- only to fall short to Mr Trumps upstart operation Donors conceded that ultimately no amount of money could match Mr Trumps crisp pitch aimed at the economically downtrodden to make America great again You can have the greatest field program and we did -- he had nothing said Jay S Jacobs a prominent New York Democrat and donor to Mrs Clinton You can have better ads paid for by greater funds and we did Unfortunately Trump had the winning argument Mrs Clinton has kept a low profile since her concession speech at a Midtown Manhattan hotel on Wednesday On Thursday a young mother with her 13-month-old daughter spotted Mrs Clinton walking her dogs near her home in Chappaqua NY posting a photo of the defeated candidate on Facebook that quickly went viral along with the hashtag ImStillWithHer On Friday night Mrs Clinton thanked volunteers on a nationwide conference call Look Im not going to sugarcoat it she
