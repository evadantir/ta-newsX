1;Cuban leadership changes but thats all for now;Cubas president may no longer be named Castro but the communist system that Fidel and Raul cemented over the course of decades is not going anywhere at least not soon Raul Castro 86 and his new successor as president Miguel Diaz-Canel 57 will ensure that it survives even if more pro-market reforms are badly needed Indeed his relinquishing the presidency after 60 years of Castro rule while important is not expected to shake up Cuba in any major way at least over the short term In a historic changing of the guard on Thursday both the old president and the new one insisted the regime will live on with Castro retaining the key position of head of the all-powerful communist party until 2021 In his first speech as president Diaz-Canel a career party loyalist said Castro will still preside over decisions of major importance for the present and future of the nation There is no room for a transition that ignores the legacy of so many years of struggle said Diaz-Canel The Council of State the supreme executive body that he oversees got some new faces at Thursdays meeting of the National Assembly But some representatives of the old guard retained their seats They include Salvador Valdes Mesa 72 Leopoldo Cintra Frias 76 or Ramiro Valdes 85 So it is hard to imagine suddenly change and reform will occur at an accelerated pace said Peter Hakim of a Washington-based think tank called the Inter-American Dialogue If the communist system is here to stay for now changes in Cuba -- where people make an average of US30 a month -- are necessary and some are already in place Castro used his farewell speech to announce constitutional reforms to adapt the charter to political economic and social transformations that have taken place in Cuba These changes which could include the creation of the job of prime minister will be submitted to a referendum But Castro did not go into detail and he insisted in any case that Cuban socialism is irrevocable and the role of the communist party will not change Diaz-Canel is an electrical engineer by training and is no specialist in economics But his main task will be to press ahead with reforms that have introduced at least a taste of market-style economic life in a system where the state calls all the shots and people live on next to nothing These timid changes ushered in by Raul Castro must go even further to shore up an economy that is stagnant -- it grew only 16 percent in 2017 -- and heavily dependent on imports and aid from ally Venezuela which now has huge economic woes of its own The most urgent tasks are to unify the currency system -- Cuba has two kinds of peso -- and decentralize the economy and political system said Arturo Lopez-Levy a Cuba expert at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley The hardest part will be to confront the political consequences of those reforms and the pressure these might trigger for yet another wave of change he added As to the dual-currency system unique in the world and a source of distortion in the economy Castro admittted it has given Cuban leaders serious headaches for years To those who think Cuba might follow the paths of former strictly communist countries like Vietnam or China Diaz-Canel warned there is no chance of capitalism being restored in Cuba This legislature will defend the revolution and work toward perfecting it he said It is not going to happen overnight Cuban political scientist Esteban Morales said of the idea of more reform As Cubans wait to see the makeup of the next cabinet of ministers a decision that has been put off until July many are watching for the kind of relationship that develops between Castro and Diaz-Canel For the first time in decades the president of the Council of State and the Council of Ministers will not also head the communist party Obviously Rauls behavior will be viewed closely but if he undermines Diaz-Canel that will be seen as Raul admitting having made the wrong choice And also suggest the very idea of a smooth transition was being challenged said Paul Webster Hare a professor of international relations at Boston University and former British ambassador to Cuba So Raul has invested a lot in Diaz-Canel and needs him to survive;News;World;Sat, April 21, 2018 09:00 am;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/04/20/cuban-leadership-changes-but-thats-all-for-now.html

129;Obesity among Asia-Pacific children is a growing health crisis - researchers;Obesity rates among children in Asia-Pacific are rising at a rapid rate and more action is needed to encourage healthier lifestyles and ease pressure on fledgling healthcare systems researchers said The number of overweight children under five rose 38 percent between 2000 and 2016 in the region and the problem is growing said Sridhar Dharmapuri a food safety and nutrition officer at the UNs Food and Agriculture Organization FAO in Bangkok The rate of growth in obesity in Asia-Pacific is higher than in many other countries Dharmapuri told the Thomson Reuters Foundation While the United States leads the way on obesity rates the number of overweight children in Asia-Pacific is rising rapidly and many countries in this region are now among the most health-threatened in the world Adult obesity rates are highest in the United States Mexico New Zealand and Hungary and lowest in Japan and South Korea according to a report on member states by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development But the rapid rise in obesity among young people in Asia-Pacific is worrying because overweight children are at higher risk of becoming obese as adults and then developing serious health problems like type 2 diabetes high blood pressure and liver disease Malaysia Indonesia Singapore and Thailand are among the most overweight countries in Southeast Asia while Samoa Tonga and Nauru are the most overweight in the Pacific Australia also has high rates of obesity Many of these nations are also struggling to tackle malnutrition among their citizens The cost to the Asia-Pacific region of citizens being overweight or obese is 166 billion a year a recent report by the Asian Development Bank Institute ADBI said Rising wealth levels over the last 20 years have played a major role in the rise in obesity levels researchers say The region has undergone economic growth so food has become available at a relatively cheaper price said Matthias Helble an economist at the ADBI in Tokyo For the last 20 years the economic growth has been almost uninterrupted said Helble who has researched obesity levels in the region for three years The obesity time bomb will be discussed by the 46 member governments attending the FAO conference for Asia and the Pacific which starts in Fiji from Monday LIFESTYLE CHOICES In addition to consuming more as economies have grown people in Asia-Pacific have moved away from farming into manufacturing and then to service sector jobs - which are more sedentary researchers said Cities in Asia-Pacific have also seen unprecedented growth over the last two decades this year more than half the regions population will for the first time be urban the United Nations has estimated City-dwellers in Asia-Pacific can spend hours commuting - due to poor transport systems and infrastructure - and when they finally reach home they have little time to cook Many opt to eat out This new lifestyle has caused a rise in the consumption of convenience and processed foods which often contain excess fats and more salt and sugar researchers said People in the region also struggle to maintain a balanced diet said Dharmapuri with meals often lacking vegetables The diet is largely rice-based he said On anybodys plate rice takes up between 50-70 percent of the space When people are overweight they often suffer from other health problems economists said and this is likely to put pressure on public healthcare systems that are only just being established in many Asia-Pacific nations Absenteeism from work is also higher among obese people said Helble adding that overweight people often die earlier than those who lead healthy lives so have a shorter productive life The term obesogenic environment has been used to describe an environment that promotes obesity among individuals and populations Elizabeth Ingram of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare - a government statistics agency - said by email It includes physical economic political and sociocultural factors JOINT EFFORT Fixing the problem will likely take years and researchers said a joint effort by business and governments was needed Better labeling on foods to promote healthier options education about healthier diets and lifestyles and even healthier school meals would improve the situation analysts said Being obese can also be seen as a sign of prosperity because you have enough food to show your wealth through the fact that you have a lot to eat said Helble Sugar taxes which have been introduced or are being discussed in the Philippines Singapore and Indonesia are also one way to change peoples mindset he added Building more sports facilities at schools and ensuring urban planners include recreational areas for cities and make them more walkable and less polluted is also crucial Governments must work with retailers like in Singapore to create a coordinated approach on packaging and promote a balanced diet researchers said Working with retailers to ban unhealthy and sweet foods from checkout areas and pushing street vendors to switch from fried foods to healthier more traditional options are also key And countries should adopt a farm to fork approach which encourages farmers to diversify what they grow and be less reliant on growing just rice said Dharmapuri In some Pacific island countries its actually easier to buy soft drinks and processed foods than buy fruits and vegetables said Dharmapuri Its almost a delicacy to have a vegetable in a restaurant;News;World;Mon, April 9, 2018 09:00 am;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/04/09/obesity-among-asia-pacific-children-is-a-growing-health-crisis---researchers.html

131;Hungarys PM Orban claims victory as his party takes sweeping poll lead;Hungarys firebrand nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed a historic victory Sunday as his right-wing party took a thumping lead in the countrys key parliamentary election With almost 98 percent of votes counted Orbans Fidesz party has won 4881 percent of the vote the National Election Office NVI said surpassing even the expectations of many within Fidesz The score represents an improvement on four years ago and puts the 54-year-old premier on track for a third consecutive term in office -- and more possible clashes with Brussels Voter turnout had reached 6926 percent up more than seven points on elections in 2014 the NVI said with several polling stations forced to open late to accommodate the increase Addressing flag-waving supporters in Budapest late on Sunday Orban said the result gave Hungarians the opportunity to defend themselves and to defend Hungary The crowd cheered as a giant TV screen showed electoral maps of the country almost completely covered in Fideszs orange colour -No opposition here - At end of his speech Orban led the crowd in singing a song from the countrys 1848 revolution Long Live Hungarian Freedom One supporter 53-year-old Eva Halasz said Viktor is the only leader for Hungary this proves he has the nation behind him there is no-one in this country like him there is no opposition here Before the vote it had been thought that a surge in voter turnout would favour the opposition Jobbik a far-right party that has been moving towards the centre and the centre-left Socialists However with nearly all votes counted results show Jobbik trailing far behind with 1967 percent the Socialists on 1242 percent and the environmentalist LMP party on 697 percent Jobbiks leader Gabor Vona resigned on Sunday night as he had promised to do if Jobbik didnt win and railed against the lies and constant attacks his party had had to face in the campaign It became clear on Sunday night Vona will struggle to win the seat he contested in his hometown of Gyoengyoes - Mass immigration rejected - Orban will likely seize on the results as vindication of his clashes with EU institutions over his hardline anti-immigration policies and rejection of the EUs refugee resettlement programme as well as his moves to clamp down on civil society groups An Orban victory will also provide a fillip for other nationalist politicians and those on the far-right around Europe who look to him as an inspiration In his speech Orban himself thanked Jaroslaw Kaczynski leader of Polands governing PiS party for his support Poland and Hungary see each other as key allies in their battles with EU institutions Frances far-right leader Marine Le Pen tweeted her congratulations on Sunday night saying the reversal of values and mass immigration promoted by the EU has been rejected once again Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders was also quick to welcome the excellent result These elections have proved that migration is indeed a winning card for Orbans Fidesz In the current Hungarian context migration prevails against all other issues from corruption to healthcare analyst Andras Biro-Nagy from the Policy Solutions think-tank told AFP In terms of what a third Fidesz term may hold Biro-Nagy said we should take seriously what Orban promised to his opponents in a speech on 15 March In that speech Orban had said he would take unspecified moral political and legal measures against his opponents after the vote prompting fears of a crackdown on opposition - Supermajority - Fidesz may even be on track to win its coveted two-thirds supermajority in parliament which would grant it wide powers to press ahead with controversial measures and change the constitution Some of the previous measures passed using this mechanism include those that have put Orban on a collision course with Brussels They include what critics call the erosion of media and judicial independence as well as its crackdown on civil society organisations linked to liberal US billionaire George Soros Orban accuses Soros and the organisations he funds of promoting mass Muslim and African immigration into Europe in order to undermine its Christian identity The last few weeks of the campaign were marked by allegations of money laundering and corruption levelled at Orbans inner circle often published in media owned by oligarch Lajos Simicska an erstwhile Orban ally who fell out with him after Fideszs 2014 election victory The oppositions campaign had focused on corruption and deteriorating public services as well as the governments failure to stem a high level of emigration which has seen the countrys population fall under the symbolic 10 million mark Definitive results will not be issued for several days after ballots sent by expatriate Hungarians and ethnic Hungarians in neighbouring countries are counted;News;World;Mon, April 9, 2018 07:47 am;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/04/09/hungarys-pm-orban-claims-victory-as-his-party-takes-sweeping-poll-lead.html

212;Will US-China trade war hurt efforts to solve North Korea nuclear crisis;The growing trade discord between China and the US is fueling concerns that it may hurt efforts to rein in North Koreas nuclear crisis On Tuesday the Trump administration proposed levying 25 percent tariffs on 1300 Chinese goods which would add up to about US50 billion annually In retaliation China on Wednesday announced plans to impose its own 25 percent tariff on 50 billion worth of US exports including aircraft cars and soybeans Earlier China imposed levies on 3 billion worth of US fruits nuts pork and wine to protest the Trump administrations move to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China last month The ramped-up trade dispute comes only weeks before US President Donald Trump is set to have a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un before the end of May which is expected to shape the fate of the Korean Peninsula Both the US South Koreas closest ally and China North Koreas traditional ally are committed to the complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula but they have differing positions on how to achieve the goal The US calls for the North to dismantle its nuclear weapons programs before any incentives such as the lifting of sanctions are considered China on the other hand backs the Norths denuclearization in phases As conflicts over bilateral trade escalate the worlds largest economies might be tempted to use the North Korea issue to win leverage over each other experts say Conflicts on the trade front between the US and China could have a negative impact on resolving North Koreas nuclear issue as it could lead them to be less willing to cooperate on the security front said Kang Jun-young a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies China could use the North Korea card during negotiations with the US as the relations between China and the North have apparently improved he said The North Korean leader is aware of it so he appears to be trying to take advantage of the rift between the US and China competing for power in Asia Chinas assistance is essential in denuclearizing the North US intelligence officials say that North Korea could be just a few months away from successfully mounting a warhead on a missile that could reach the American mainland China has proved itself to be still a major player in matters regarding the Korean Peninsula after North Korean leader Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing Their meeting dismissed Chinas concerns that it is losing influence over North Korea and increasingly being sidelined in negotiations between the Koreas and the US over the Norths nuclear weapons programs The stakes are high for both the US and China as the result of a potential trade war has massive ramifications for both Trump and Xi domestically Trump is facing mid-term elections in November while Xi has just begun his second term as president with an option to rule for life and probably wants to expand his clout abroad President Trump downplayed concerns over a trade war with China but made it clear he will not back down We are not in a trade war with China that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the US he wrote on Twitter Now we have a Trade Deficit of 500 Billion a year with Intellectual Property Theft of another 300 Billion We cannot let this continue China which is Americas largest foreign creditor and the No 2 overall owner of US government bonds also does not appear to be willing to give into the pressure To rise as a global power Xi tightened his grip domestically Now he is pressured not to lose in the competition with the US He can rally Chinese people behind his leadership by fighting back against the US Kang said But even if ongoing trade skirmishes lead to an all-out trade war between the US and China the broad agreement to hold dialogue with the North to tackle the nuclear standoff will stay valid as denuclearization of North Korea is in both the US and Chinas interests he said In Trumps mind his America First policy means that he puts the revival of the US economy first before anything else He could use the North Korea issue in his negotiations with China to draw favorable results on trade said Park Won-gon a professor at Handong Global University There is a possibility that Trump will use the North Korea card to put pressure on China to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue he said It is his typical style to push the other side into a corner to maximize his bargaining power Trumps tying of trade issues with North Korea was a warning to South Korea that it should closely coordinate with the US and stay on the same page in achieving North Koreas denuclearization said Kim Hyun-wook a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy The US and South Korean trade representatives have agreed US steel tariffs would not apply to South Korean firms and that South Korea would lift restrictions on US automobiles But during a speech in Richfield Ohio Trump appeared to be throwing a wrench into the recent agreement linking his pending decision on the trade deal with South Korea to the success of upcoming US talks with North Korea because it is a very strong card South Korea should maintain a strong alliance and coordination with the US to make sure the US stays in the game without being alienated professor Kim said But it also could be an opportunity for South Korea he pointed out When the US and China are too cooperative it is

in the next decade Every Asian country big or small has a role to play for prosperity and peace he told the forum The economies will encounter challenges ahead But we will not be deterred We seek to partner with responsible businesses  homegrown and foreign-based  to drive the progress we envision Duterte said in his speech at the opening of the forum Duterte said the Philippines remains committed to interconnectivity innovation and investment We will continue our efforts to broaden and deepen our economic engagement and cooperation with our friends and neighbors We must harness the potential for shared growth in our region and beyond he said As sovereign equals the Philippines and China are partners in the building of much-needed infrastructure he stressed We are buildingbridges of greater understanding between our people We are working together on strengthening economic complementarities Let me say it again today The Philippines destiny is in Asia The Philippines is ready to work with all nations in the region who seek friendship and cooperation he said Duterte said the Philippines has dreamed of a comfortable life for its citizens envisioning a society with opportunities for all and a nation of hard-working talented and law-abiding people We are slowly making the Filipino dream a reality Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is concerned that the trading regime underpinned by the World Trade Organization WTO is eroding As nations look inward and turn their backs on globalization we in Asia confront a strategic choice Whether to follow suit or to script an alternative more hopeful vision for our future he told the forum Our coordinated and tailored approaches must incorporate the enterprising spirit of our people and their common aspirations for a better life They must include embracing structural reform strengthening regional institutions increasing connectivity leveraging technology and investing in human capital Abbasi said that today China is a global leader in addressing climate change and in promoting global trade equitable development and a sustainable world I firmly believe that development and security remain intrinsically indivisible he said Only by spreading the dividends of open trade and shared innovation will we be able to promote tolerance and amity and deny space to extremism The China-Pakistan-Afghanistan trilateral framework is aimed at achieving these very objectives President Xis historic Belt and Road Initiative has become a global public good beneficial to all for shared prosperity and bringing equality to an unequal world Abbasi said In Pakistan today step by step brick by brick a brave new Asia is taking shape The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor the flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative is fast reaching fruition It is an excellent example of an open coordinated and inclusive development paradigm that benefits all stakeholders he said Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his address at the Boao Forum opening ceremony that the multilateral WTO system must be the basis for global trade Since China joined the WTO in 2001 its weight in the global economy and its share of world trade has grown enormously and this has greatly benefited China itself and many other countries of the world including Singapore he said Lee emphasized concerns over the impact of high tariffs for countries big and small Singapore does not believe that imposing unilateral tariffs is the correct solution as they are not compliant with the WTOs rules There will always be competition between major powers but it makes all the difference whether competition occurs within a framework of interdependence and generally accepted rules of the game Lee said More fundamentally as economists point out the focus on the bilateral trade imbalance between the US and China is misplaced he said What matters to a country is not its bilateral trade balance with a specific trading partner but its overall trade balance with the rest of the world Furthermore the cause of a trade deficit is an imbalance in the domestic economy in particular when a country consumes more than it produces Lee also said that China has responded to the United States trade salvos accordingly and is careful and calibrated Nevertheless there is now a serious dispute Everyone still hopes that before these tariffs are implemented the two countries will be able to work out an accommodation and head off further escalation he added Mongolian Prime Minister Ukhnaa Khurelsukh said at the forum that openness and connectivity are conducive to healthy economic development United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that globalization has brought benefits but the goal should be fair globalization that leaves no one behind One thing must be very clear We wont make globalization fair by isolationism protectionism or exclusion he told the forum Global problems need global multiple solutions Multilateral connectivity and cooperation should be emphasized so as to achieve peace dignity and prosperity for all mankind Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde also identified the importance of Asia to global growth and she emphasized economic openness Others who spoke at the April 10 opening of the Boao Forum included Austrian President Alexander

278;Pompeo Trumps pick to be secretary of state vows diplomatic approach to Iran;President Donald Trumps pick to become Washingtons top diplomat pledged Thursday to work with US allies to strengthen the Iran deal and played down fears he is bent on regime change in North Korea Mike Pompeo the outgoing director of the Central Intelligence Agency disavowed his reputation as a war hawk and an anti-Muslim hardliner as he sought to woo support from senators to become the next US secretary of state He told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he would restore swagger to a State Department left in tatters by Rex Tillerson and strengthen relations with US partners left ragged after the tumultuous first year of President Donald Trumps administration Pompeo a former congressman emphasized his close relationship with Trump -- something Tillerson never had -- and his time at the CIA which he said had given him a strong appreciation for the necessity to work closely with foreign partners He promised to fill scores of unoccupied diplomatic posts to spend time with the staff and delegate authority saying current state department staff are demoralized and do not feel relevant All of this -- listening leveraging differences unleashing talent teamwork -- will become the fabric of a State Department culture that finds its swagger once again he said With a series of tough foreign policy challenges looming Trump has made the 54- year-old West Point and Harvard Law graduate a key aide for his second year in office along with fellow arch-conservative John Bolton who joined the White House this week as the presidents national security advisor Bolton later lavished praise on Pompeo describing him as a talented and experienced public servant as well as a good friend We need him as secretary of state as we support the president and take on some of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time he said in a statement In his CIA post Pompeo has already taken the lead in arranging a potentially breakthrough summit with North Koreas Kim Jong-un on denuclearization The Trump administration also faces crucial decisions on how to react to the use of chemical weapons in Syria more sanctions on Russia and a deadline to confirm the 2015 Iran nuclear deal the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action With a history of provocative statements against Iran Pompeos nomination was seen as a sign that Trumps administration intends to rip up the accord But on Thursday he strove to emphasize that he would work to fix the deal with skeptical European allies by a May 12 deadline Both Frances President Emmanuel Macron and Germanys Chancellor Angela Merkel are due to visit Washington on separate official visits before May 12 in part to lobby Trump to preserve a deal they see as the best way to stop Tehran getting a nuclear bomb Pompeo confirmed that as CIA director he had seen no evidence that Iran had broken its side of the bargain and believes that Tehran would not be able to quickly develop nuclear weapons should the agreement fail Ive seen no evidence that they are not in compliance today he told the committee I want to fix this deal Thats the objective If there is no chance to fix it Ill recommend to the president we do our level best to work with our allies to achieve a better outcome and better deal Even after May 12th even after May 12th theres still much diplomatic work to be done Pompeo -- who once hinted he would not be bothered if North Koreas Kim were assassinated -- was also asked whether he favors US military action to overthrow the nuclear weapon-armed regime in Pyongyang Im not advocating for regime change he stressed I lean more closely to the presidents view which is to continue to pressure the country to build a diplomatic coalition around the world to put pressure on Kim Jong-un so that we can achieve the United States goals without ever having to put one of our men or women in harms way He was also quizzed on former statements when he was a congressman from Kansas that have led him to be cast as anti-Muslim and anti-gay But he cited his record in the CIA as supporting a diverse workforce focusing on mission and demanding that every team member be treated equally and with dignity and respect After five hours of testimony though Pompeos confirmation by the committee and then the entire Senate was not assured even though his nomination in early 2017 as CIA director passed easily One Republican senator on the committee Rand Paul has declared himself opposed meaning at least one Democrat will have to cross party lines and support him to see the nomination through to a full vote But Senator Lindsey Graham a Republican hawk on foreign policy has said Pompeo would be taking over during a dangerous period

453;What you need to know about Jakartas water privatization;A group of Jakarta residents have clinched a victory in a long legal battle against tap water privatization after the Supreme Court ruled in their favor in October 2017 Why are they against privatization The Jakarta Post has compiled the most essential information about the issue Whats the story behind privatization Jakartas water was managed by city-owned PT PAM Jaya However under the advice of the World Bank in 1995 then-president Soeharto ordered water privatization appointing two foreign companies without open bidding The World Bank believed privatization was the cure for the failure of Jakartas public water delivery and unequal access to water Private companies are expected to deliver better management thus providing the necessary investment for the water company On June 6 1997 PAM signed a 25-year agreement with French Suez Environment which together with Salim group founded PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya Palyja and British Thames Water with Soehartos son Sigit Harjojudanto through PT Kekar Thames Airindo now PT Aetra Air Jakarta Salim group was owned by Lim Sioe Liong or Sudono Salim a tycoon who was known as Soehartos close ally The contract said the two private firms would pay PAM Jayas debt In 1991 the World Bank lent US92 million for PAM Jaya to improve the service Before privatization in 1996 PAM Jaya recorded only 453 percent tap water coverage and 57 percent of non-revenue water There was an effort to make Palyja public by acquiring the shares via city-owned PT Jakarta Propertindo Jakpro which was aborted in 2015 Aetra was owned by Deputy Governor Sandiaga Uno before he sold his shares to Salim to avoid conflicts of interest The battle to end Jakartas water privatization began in November 2012 when the Coalition of Jakarta Residents Opposing Water Privatization KMMSAJ filed a class action lawsuit to annul the 1997 contract on the basis that the partnership had failed to serve the people in the city What is the condition of water coverage in Jakarta Jakartas water distribution is unequal against the poor Under the Dutch colonial administration only affluent residential areas enjoyed direct water pipe access After independence the pattern persisted A United Nations Development Programme UNDP report citing data from the Kampung Improvement Program KIP and the World Bank found that in the 1970s 90 percent of residents in kampungs did not have access to water pipes despite being home to 80 percent of the population Lack of sanitation exacerbated the problem as clean water sources such as rivers or ponds degraded in quality due to human and household waste In 2015 tap water only covered 60 percent of Jakartas residents according to PAM Jaya president director Sriwidayanto Kaderi By 2016 the number of residents connected to a piped water system amounted to 3420000 people The Amrta Institute for Water Literacy however calculates that tap water only supplies 35 percent of Jakartas total water demand because even though households and commercial buildings are connected to tap water service they still use groundwater The urban poor in North Jakarta have it harder they buy from local vendors or use groundwater surface water and others The World Bank reported Jakartas poor households have to spend 13 to 25 percent of their income on water According to the Jakarta Water Resources Council the countrys capital can only supply 22 percent of its total demand for clean water from the Krukut River with another 80 percent coming from the Jatiluhur Reservoir and about 20 percent from Cisadane River in Tangerang Banten How does privatization work Privatization means that PAM Jaya only acts as a supervisor while the operations are in the hands of private companies Palyja is responsible for water operations in the western half of the city while PT Aetra Air Jakarta is responsible for the eastern half Both share high-income customers in business districts The two water operators are responsible for ensuring the raw water supply cleaning the raw water pipe network and customer service PAM Jaya pays a water charge to the two private operators to supply water to the residents while customers pay water tariffs Based on the contract the water charge is increased every semester but the water tariff cannot be automatically increased because it often involves a political process with the City Council As a result water charges are mostly higher than the tariffs increasing PAM Jayas expenses A former PAM Jaya director Maurits Napitupulu said if the rate continued PAM Jaya would have to pay Rp 182 trillion by the time the contract ended in 2022 Key dates on the water privatization debacle Why do Jakartas citizens reject water privatization The KMMSAJ said water privatization had failed to guarantee an adequate supply of clean potable water in the capital After almost 20 years of operations the two private firms have failed to reach the target agreed in the 1997 contract The targets after privatization in the 1997 agreement were to have 98 percent service coverage and to decrease non-revenue water to 20 percent by the 20th year In 2015 the water coverage for both private operators was 59 percent and the leakage 44 percent Meanwhile the group complained the water tariffs were not affordable for the citys poor residents Jakartans pay around Rp 7000 71 US cents per cubic meter with the exception of low-income residents who pay only Rp 1050 per cubic meter The failure to reach the water coverage target has defeated the purpose of privatization as suggested by the World Bank to provide affordable clean water also for the poor As a result the poor have to buy expensive clean water from other sources According to the World Bank poor households in Jakarta have been spending an estimated 13 to 25 percent of their income on water Ministerial Regulation No 232006 on water rate adjustment states that a household should not have to spend more than 4 percent of its income on water necessary for daily use The Central Jakarta District Court approved the KMMSAJs lawsuit in 2015 ending water privatization Presiding judge Iim Nurkhoim said water privatization had been negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakartas residents Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution states clearly that land and water and the natural resources contained therein shall be controlled by the state and shall be used for the greatest prosperity of the people In 2016 however the Jakarta High Court overturned the lower courts decision granting the rights once again for water privatization The verdict was mainly based on technicalities of the KMMSAJs lawsuit What is the Supreme Courts 2017 verdict on water privatization The Supreme Court approved a cassation appeal filed by the KMMSAJ and annulled a 2016 verdict issued by the Jakarta High Court The verdict states that privatization had not improved the service of water supply in term of quality quantity and continuity The Supreme Court ordered the termination of water privatization as it contravened Jakartas Bylaw No 131992 on city-owned water company PAM Jaya Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan has said he was committed to respecting the Supreme Courts ruling that ordered a stop to the privatization of pipe water supply in the city However PAM Jaya has insisted that it would continue to cooperate with the two private companies but would restructure the agreement giving PAM Jaya more authority in the operation The Jakarta administration will form a team pertaining to the controversial restructuring between city-owned tap water company PAM Jaya with private-run PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya Palyja and PT Aetra Air Jakarta an official said ;News;City;Thu,

467;Vietnam eyes tourism reform;Vietnams tourism industry is booming and is fast becoming the driving force behind economic growth  but it also faces calls for reform to keep up with high standards The smoke-free industry has witnessed spectacular success in the past few years with higher growth rate every year Last year nearly 13 million foreign visitors came to our shores earning the country more than Vietnamese dong VND 500 trillion US22 billion Thats up 30 percent and 20 percent year-on-year respectively Over the decade the number of international visitors to Vietnam has tripled while revenue has increased by nine times Vietnams tourism ranked sixth in the top 10 fastest growing tourism destinations globally and was crowned the best performer in Asia in 2017 The industry last year contributed 75 per cent to the nations GDP With such impressive achievements tourism has been identified a key economic sector by 2020 It can help boost the development of other sectors including construction real estate retail education and job opportunities A Politburo resolution on developing tourism and seeing it evolve into a major player in Vietnams economy was introduced last year The nation hopes to welcome 17-20 million foreign arrivals and 82 million domestic tourists by 2020 Tourism revenue is expected to reach 35 billion contributing 10 percent to the countrys GDP by then and the industry may create four million jobs including 16 million direct jobs Tourism is forecast to maintain strong development in the next few years thanks to the Governments support policies determination of provincial authorities and dynamic development of both businesses and communities However such rapid expansion is exposing many challenges and if the industry cannot be restructured to break bottlenecks it could be beaten by overdevelopment Rapid increase in the number of visitors to Vietnam in the short term is putting the industry under great pressure of transport infrastructure human resource and destination management capacity said Nguyen Quy Phuong director of Travel Management Department under the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism Phuong said infrastructure deficiencies particularly overloaded airports will likely make tourists worn out due to long waiting while the lack of adequate human resource and public management capacity in destinations will affect service quality In reality airports in major cities such as Hanoi Ho Chi Minh City Hue and Da Nang are facing the overload trouble Half of the people who visited from overseas last year flew into Tan Son Nhat International Airport in HCM City It was built to accommodate 25 million passengers per year but in 2016 32 million came through its doors According to Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index 2017 of the World Economic Forum Vietnams tourist service infrastructure ranked 113th out of 136 economies airport infrastructure 61st ground traffic 71st IT platform 80th clean and safe environment 82nd and international openness mainly visas 73rd Urgent attention should be paid to upgrade of transport infrastructure including seaports in the context of increasing demand for cruise tourism as well as improvements in visa and immigration procedures Phuong said Vu The Binh deputy chairman of Vietnam Tourism Association also stressed the need to create a greater experience for visitors highlighting the problems with visas Vietnam has granted visa waivers for visitors from 24 countries while applying electronic visa to citizens of 46 countries However according to Binh these numbers are still feeble compared with Thailand which awards free-visa for tourists of 67 countries and Indonesia which waives visa for citizens of 169 countries and territories Not only that also procedure of visa exemption applied for foreigners is quite complicated creating inconvenience and displeasure for both foreign visitors and travel companies Binh was quoted as saying on theThoi bao kinh te Viet NamVietnam Economic Times For a long time Vietnams tourism has been developed in a spontaneous manner Individuality is key and many regions hope to promote their own unique brands to showcase to the world but they mostly do so in keeping with the national strategy Important things to consider include tourists needs promotional campaigns infrastructure human resources and management According to Trinh Thi My Nghe vice chairman of Hanoi City Tourism Association tourism is not a single industry but a collective one relating to other sectors and subjects Good infrastructure management safety hygiene and friendly citizens are all surface factors to attract visitors Nghe toldViet Nam News Travel companies design and sell products to tourists and the local authorities are responsible for organisation and management of destinations Apart from visiting beautiful landscape foreign tourists coming to Vietnam want to learn more about Vietnamese culture meet and experience the local living she said adding that responsibility of businesses and community is to study customer demand to design attractive products Tourism development also requires inter-regional coordination Vietnam has developed several successful regional tourism brands such as the connection of the eight Northwestern provinces and cluster of the three central provinces Thua Thien-Hue Da Nang and Quang Nam The Government is also urged to improve the business environment to ensure the deep participation of private businesses and community in the national tourism development strategy Vietnam hopes for around 16 million foreign visitors 80 million domestic arrivals and VND620 trillion in total tourism revenue in 2018 These are considered achievable goals but

499;Uber cant afford to be an ugly American abroad;Anybody who commutes via ride-share in one of Southeast Asias traffic-choked cities knows that Uber Technologies has always been an also-ran in the fast-growing region Compared with Grab Taxi Holdings the dominant ride-sharing company in Southeast Asia it consistently had fewer cars available and was perpetually behind in offering localized services When Uber announced Monday that it was selling its Southeast Asian operations to Grab it merely confirmed the worst-kept secret in Southeast Asian business Uber however might be holding on to an even bigger secret As data sharing and online privacy become key concerns for governments worldwide Uber and its competitors will be forced to invest in the locals rather than compete against them Multinational ride-sharing companies like Uber will have to become regional players expert in local preferences and in managing the governments who regulate them In many ways Ubers failure in Southeast Asia reflects its struggles in other regions -- especially fast-growing developing ones The first problem it faced was its lack of a first-mover advantage The global availability of smartphones mapping technology and tech talent allowed companies to develop Uber-like services for local markets before Uber itself could arrive In Southeast Asia Grab was that company it started offering rides a year ahead of Uber But even without that head start Grabs founders had the advantage of knowing the locals better For example Grab offered a cash payment option as early as 2012 in order to expand the service to the millions of Southeast Asians who dont have credit cards Uber which entered the market in 2013 didnt offer a cash option until much later And by the time Uber had caught up on cash payments Grab and GoJek Indonesia Indonesias ride-share leader were building their platforms into nascent financial service providers for unbanked consumers across their emerging markets Ubers single-minded focus on ride-sharing meant that it could never develop as deep a relationship with local consumers and drivers Similar localization problems have dogged Uber elsewhere In Nigeria drivers are known to use a fake GPS itinerary app to boost Ubers discounted unrealistic fares in Kenya Uber is playing catch-up with local ride-sharing players that have expanded services to offer tuk-tuks motorcycles and the ability for companies to hail vehicles for employees and in India Uber is trailing home-grown Ola which provides services in a dozen languages allows users to hail rides via text message crucial in countries where connectivity is poor and expensive and -- like its Southeast Asian counterparts -- has moved past Uber into digital payments But the biggest threat to Uber -- and anyone else aspiring to create a multinational ride-sharing company -- is growing concern about data privacy In the course of its brief history Uber has been plagued by several scandals related to its handling of user data So far none of those have risen to a level of existential threat on the order of Facebooks recent privacy travails But thats been a matter of luck more than planning Ride-sharing companies gather and store massive amounts of the kinds of user data that other entities are keen to use and that governments are determined to control and regulate Access to that data is becoming an issue in several markets in which Uber operates Last year the Egyptian government requested that Uber and its chief competitor Dubai-based Careem provide access to the companys live data on customers and their journeys in exchange for preferential treatment in the country Both companies refused the request in the interest of customer privacy It was a principled stand but it may have carried a price Last week an Egyptian court ordered Uber and Careem to halt operations in Egypt A local company with better government relations may not have faced the same penalty Meanwhile even before Uber sold out to Chinas Didi Chuxing Technology the governments interest in securing Chinese data was clearly going to make it difficult for Uber to operate independently In the last year China has required all internet companies to store data collected on Chinese users within China -- a regulation which presumably makes that data easier for the government to access At the same time China is restricting the ability of foreign companies to produce the high-definition digital maps of China necessary to operate autonomous vehicles in the country If autonomous vehicles are the future of ride-sharing -- and Uber believes they are -- then it will be difficult for all but Chinese companies to offer ride-sharing services in China Of course these sorts of data sovereignty concerns arent confined to China Just as the Chinese government is wary of Uber collecting data on Chinese consumers regulators in the EU and the US will be wary of Chinese ride-sharing companies collecting and storing data on EU and US consumers So far emerging markets like Southeast Asia and Africa arent showing the same concerns over privacy But local players seeking a marketing advantage could certainly use it as a wedge to encourage governments to regulate Uber and other interlopers For Uber and other aspiring multinational ride-sharing companies that leaves a shrinking map of possibilities in which to operate and succeed In the long term the best option might be the one taken by Uber in Russia China and now Southeast Asia exchange its current business for a minority stake in the local player and hope that it prospers Thats a far less ambitious outlook than the one Uber envisioned But in a world where local differences and privacy concerns are ascendant it may be the only route to international ride-sharing success;News;Business;Wed, March 28, 2018 12:13 pm;http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/03/28/uber-cant-afford-to-be-an-ugly-american-abroad.html

600;Will Facebook Indonesia face criminal charges for data breach;With more than 1 million Indonesian users affected in the Facebook data-breach scandal the National Police have decided to launch a criminal investigation into the case On Wednesday the police questioned Facebook Indonesia public policy head Ruben Hattari at the forces headquarters in their first attempt to shed light on the case It remains unclear however if the ongoing probe could ever lead to criminal charges against Facebook or its representatives here Below is what we know so far about the Facebook scandal in Indonesia What is the data-breach scandal about The Facebook data-breach scandal refers to the data harvesting by a third party political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica CA CA harvested data and used it for marketing or political campaigning allegedly helping US President Donald Trump win his presidency CA was also contracted by one of Indonesias major political parties in 1999 While Facebook also harvests its users data and monetizes the data to run advertisements on its platform Facebook does not sell the data to advertisers as confirmed by founder Mark Zuckerberg during a recent US Congress hearing on the matter CA managed to harvest the data through two University of Cambridge academics Aleksandr Kogan and Michal Kosinski Kogan initially created This is Your Digital Life for research purposes the personality test app was downloaded by 270000 people but also collected the data of the downloaders friends boosting this number to 87 million users 1 million of whom were Indonesians This is why the Facebook-CA data breach is scandalous Kogans app collected users data without their permission and the data was improperly sold to a third party How big is Facebook in Indonesia As quoted by kompascom Indonesia has the fourth-highest number of Facebook users in the world As of January there were 130 million accounts on the social network or 6 percent of the total global users The cities with the most active users in Indonesia are Bekasi in West Java with 18 million accounts and Jakarta with 16 million accounts This makes Indonesia the country with the most Facebook users in Southeast Asia How influential is Facebook in Indonesian elections Social media was largely to blame for polarizing Indonesians during the 2014 presidential election and the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election with Facebook and Twitter being the biggest platforms and therefore most influential However this had more to do with hoaxes and hate speech than data harvesting Some politicians have admitted to relying on social-media data for their campaigns but it is unclear how sophisticated and widespread their use of social media data has been Conversations regarding the elections dominated the Facebook and Twitter news feed in 2014 and peaked in 2016 Since late 2017 the National Police have caught two syndicates allegedly responsible for creating and spreading hoaxes and inciting hate speech Saracen and the Muslim Cyber Army Both groups which used fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter in their operations were critical of President Joko Jokowi Widodo and may have been organized to undermine him ahead of the 2019 presidential election Do the police have a strong case against Facebook Indonesia At this point the answer is no The investigation is still in its preliminary stage Ruben confirmed that Wednesdays questioning by the police revolved around the alleged data breach but stopped short of confirming whether he was questioned in an investigation of a criminal case built by the police National Police spokesman Insp Gen Setyo Wasisto declined to disclose details of the questioning and instead complained about the lack of cooperation on Facebooks side in combating radical content on the social-media site On Thursday National Police chief detective Comr Gen Ari Dono Sumanto made it clear the police were still investigating whether there was a crime in the data-breach scandal He admitted that they had not found a single person claiming to have suffered losses from the data breach or even claimed to have had their data stolen What are the possible charges against Facebook Data privacy is uncharted territory in Indonesia There is no data protection law in the country although a bill is expected to be passed this year The bill has been in the 2015-2019 Prolegnas since 2016 but there has been no progress in the deliberation of the draft law The closest thing to data privacy protection is Communications and Information Ministerial Regulation No 202016 but there is only a series of administrative penalties for individuals accused of misusing personal data harvested online The regulation has no stipulation regarding penalties for corporations accused of stealing personal information The 2008 Electronic Information and Transactions ITE Law which is focused on curbing hate speech and hoaxes does not specifically cover personal data protection A member of staff at the Communications and Information Ministry however has claimed that the ITE law could still be used to press charges against Facebook Article 26 of the law stipulates that the use of electronic information on an individuals personal data should be approved by the said individual Article 30 of the law further states that illegally accessing information belonging to other people is punishable by eight years imprisonment Human rights activist Wahyudi Jafar says that Facebook could be charged with interception as stipulated in Article 31 of the amended ITE law The crime is punishable by 10 years imprisonment or a Rp 5 billion US362287 fine But it wont be easy to prove this he says ahw;News;National;Thu, April 19, 2018 06:54

635;Quackery and superstition species pay the cost;A pinch of powdered chimpanzee bone some gecko saliva a dash of vulture brain These are not the ingredients of a fairytale witches brew but some of the prized substances helping drive the multi-billion dollar illegal trade in animal parts touted to cure anything from a hangover or asthma to cancer and AIDS Along with better-known products such as rhino horn pangolin scales and tiger bone dealers do a brisk trade in some more obscure ones too -- dried seahorse sloth claws manta ray gills and macaque embryos Many are creatures listed as endangered or threatened And while some of the products are key constituents in centuries-old traditional cures prescribed by healers in Asia and Africa others are fictional cure-alls sold by cynical quacks experts say We do see modern-day snake oil salesman John Scanlon secretary general of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species told AFP While stressing we will never criticize any traditional practices he condemned people who are promoting certain wildlife products as having properties that have no association with traditional medicine Theyre really preying on people in very vulnerable situations These include peddlers of rhino horn to cure cancer -- an unproven claim that has contributed to the decimation of these majestic beasts Sudan the worlds last male northern white rhino died in Kenya this week In 1960 there were an estimated 100000 black rhino in Africa -- today there are fewer 28000 rhinos of all species left in Africa and Asia according to a 2016 UN World Wildlife Crime Report The current rhino poaching crisis which began around 2007 does have its origins in bogus medicinal use said Richard Thomas of TRAFFIC which monitors wild animal trade A surge in demand in Vietnam is ascribed to a senior politician claiming in the mid-2000s that rhino horn cured his cancer This has no basis in scientific fact but was almost certainly the urban myth that led to the crisis Thomas told AFP As incomes have increased in Asia so has demand for rhino horn which can sell for tens of thousands of dollars per kilo Today rich people us it as a tonic even for hangovers and as a display of wealth And although there is a popular myth in Western society that rhino horn is used as an aphrodisiac in Asian culture it was never prescribed as such -- ironically it has now taken on such a use in Vietnam said Thomas Now banned in China Rhino horn originally was prescribed by traditional healers as a treatment for fever Some scientific studies have shown that it is somewhat effective for this purpose though not more so than aspirin Other traditional medicines have been more successfully assimilated by westerners Bear bile was found to contain an ingredient called ursodeoxycholic acid effective in treating a liver disease It is now produced synthetically Similarly the antimalarial artemisinin was originally extracted from the wormwood plant and an ingredient of the African Cherry tree is used to make prostate medicine But demand for many plant and animal ingredients today is driven by nothing other than superstition the experts say The scales of the pangolin or scaly anteater are sold raw or fried in Asia for as much as 500 per kilogram for treating asthma and migraines or stimulate milk production in breast-feeding women Of the eight pangolin species two are listed as critically endangered two as endangered and four as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature And according to Thomas there is no

690;Forget Facebook Turkey is moving to control all content;Turkey already the worlds leading jailer of journalists is squeezing what little independence is left out of its battered media President Recep Tayyip Erdogans government is widening the powers of its aggressive radio and television censor to include the internet just as 81-year-old billionaire Aydin Dogan starts talks to sell Turkeys largest private media company to a group of Erdogan loyalists ending years of harassment by authorities The moves come as Erdogan in power for 15 years prepares to cement his control with elections next year that will abolish the post of prime minister and codify what is essentially one-man rule Since a failed coup in 2016 the leader of the Middle Easts largest economy has presided over the rounding up of opponents by the tens of thousands including workers in every branch of government and leading members of the media academia and the judiciary Even Miss Turkey has been dethroned and jailed for criticizing Erdogan on Instagram while just Thursday an actress was sentenced to 10 months for allegedly insulting him from the stage This is very much following the Russian model said Asli Aydintasbas at the European Council on Foreign Relations Media outlets are all closely affiliated with the government A few exceptions are tolerated but marginalized CNN Netflix Turkeys latest efforts to control what 80 million citizens are permitted to see on their computer screens and televisions may affect some of the biggest names in American media The assets Dogan is in negotiations to sell include CNNs Turkish affiliate as well as the countrys leading daily Hurriyet and tabloid Posta Separately a law that parliament passed late Wednesday allows the states media watchdog known as RTUK to vet online broadcasts and possibly block content of both paid and free streaming services like Netflix and YouTube A member of RTUKs governing board Ilhan Tasci who was appointed by the main opposition party said vague wording in the legislation means individuals who are supposed to be exempt from oversight may end up being targeted for posting videos on the web without a license In no developed democracy can the government decide what adults watch Tasci said by phone Dogan Holding said in a regulatory filing that its negotiations with Erdogan Demirorens Demiroren Holding AS are based on a market value for the media assets of 890 million less than a quarter of the groups enterprise value at its peak in the mid-2000s That was before Dogan was slapped with multibillion-dollar fines and forced to unload some key assets Shares of Dogan Holding which also has assets in real estate manufacturing and energy soared almost 20 percent to 104 liras by 247 pm in Istanbul on Thursday after closing 19 percent higher Wednesday Shares of Hurriyet Dogan Gazetecilik and magazine publisher Dogan Dergi also jumped almost 20 percent Tearful Encounter Demirorens previous foray into media ended in tears -- literally A leaked recording of a phone call with Erdogan in 2014 revealed him crying as the Turkish leader berated him for the political coverage of one of his newspapers How did I get into this business Demiroren says on the call The 79-year-old tycoon made his fortune in industries ranging from energy and construction to industrial metals and tourism Bahadir Ozgur who spent 13 years at Dogan newspapers said the companys problems started in February 2009 when Referans a business daily that was later shuttered ran a story about nepotism among Erdogans allies in his ruling Islamist-rooted AKP party It was just about how the sons of ministers had climbed the ladders in business Ozgur said by phone Dozens of tax inspectors soon paid a visit resulting in the astronomical fines on the holding company he said Ozgur 41 has been out of work since he quit Dogan in June to protest censorship over Turkeys militarys operation to seize Afrin Syria from Kurdish YPG fighters The Committee to Protect Journalists in December identified 73 jailed Turkish journalists the most in the world for the second year running There always was censorship and self-censorship at Dogan but it was always subtle pinpointed he said For the first time we were ordered to do this or that story using this or that term or expression Not Free HalkTV operated by the main opposition party has largely

Festival the Berlinale last month Part of the film was shot in Muarojambi regency Jambi during the forest fires in 2015 Another one American-Indonesian Ashram Shahrivars Sigek Cokelat Chocolate Bar was screened at the Colorado Environmental Film Festival in the US and at the London International World Cinema event The most recent is the work of renowned documentary filmmaker Dandhy Laksonos Watchdoc titled Asimetris The film was launched this month and has circulated in the country The three share one thing in common they set out to explain the palm oil industrys detrimental effect on the environment Their international and nationwide reception appears to be just in time as the world puts the sustainability of the palm oil industry under greater scrutiny The industry helps in the production of everyday items in our life like soap cooking oil cosmetics and chocolate bars but has long been linked to deforestation in rainforest countries including Indonesia Ashram said he wanted Sigek Cokelat to be an eye-opening experience on what was really happening in West Kalimantan palm plantations referring to the decades-long deforestation that has reduced the habitat of orangutans while people enjoyed chocolate the production of which uses palm oil The Green Lie address the same issue The fact is that the palm oil industry has taken over ancestral lands damaged the environment and has even violated human rights said Feri Irawan an environmentalist in Jambi who appears in The Green Lie which was nominated for best documentary award in the Berlinale in February That kind of criticism has been strongly voiced also by international NGOs leading to what palm oil producers -- notably Indonesia and Malaysia  have called discriminatory and protectionist policies such as the European Parliaments approval in January of a bill that will limit the use of palm oil as transportation fuel starting from 2022 and Norways ban in 2017 on the public procurement and use of palm oil-based biofuel The policies could hurt Indonesias exports the countrys authorities and business players warn As the worlds largest palm oil producer Indonesia exported 31 million tons of palm oil last year or 75 percent of Indonesias total output bringing US229 billion in foreign exchange revenue Palm oil is one of primary elements of Indonesias national interest notably because it is related to the prosperity of 17 million Indonesian citizens including smallholder farmers who directly and indirectly depend on the palm oil industry the Indonesian Embassy in Brussels said in a statement after the European Parliaments move International communities have singled out Indonesian oil palm plantations in the chorus of criticism of environmental aspects of the biofuel industry Indonesian

797;How Facebook made its Cambridge Analytica data crisis even worse;Facebook tried to get ahead of its latest media firestorm Instead it helped create one The company knew ahead of time that on Saturday the New York Times and The Guardians Observer would issue bombshell reports that the data firm that helped Donald Trump win the presidency had accessed and retained information on 50 million Facebook users without their permission Facebook did two things to protect itself it sent letters to the media firms laying out its legal case for why this data leak didnt constitute a breach And then it scooped the reports using their information with a Friday blog post on why it was suspending the ad firm Cambridge Analytica from its site Both moves backfired On Friday Facebook said it received reports that Cambridge Analytica hadnt deleted the user data and that it needed to suspend the firm The statement gave the impression that Facebook had looked into the matter In fact the companys decisions were stemming from information in the news reports set to publish the next day and it had not independently verified those reports according to a person with knowledge of the matter By trying to look proactive Facebook ended up adding weight to the news On Saturday any good will the company earned by talking about the problem first was quickly undone when reporters revealed Facebooks behind-the-scenes legal maneuvering Yesterday Facebook threatened to sue us Today we publish this Carole Cadwalladr the Observer reporter wrote as she linked her story to Twitter in a post shared almost 15000 times The Guardian said it had nothing to add to her statement The Times confirmed that it too received a letter but said it didnt consider the correspondence a legal threat Front-running the stories along with the letters to newsrooms are but two of several ways Facebook failed to contain fallout from the Cambridge Analytica revelations Silence on the part of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg didnt help Nor did a report late Monday in the New York Times that Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos is leaving after clashing with other executives including Sandberg over how Facebook handled Russian disinformation campaigns Facebook said Stamos is still at the company but didnt outright deny that he plans to leave Most of its executives havent done a real interview in ages let alone answer deep questions Zeynep Tufecki an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who specializes in social networks and democracy wrote in a post on Twitter In a sign of investor dismay Facebook shares tumbled 68 percent on Monday the biggest decline since March 2014 As the stock fell and criticism from lawmakers poured in from the US and Britain the company worked to make it clear that it didnt actually have enough information on its own to react to Saturdays news reports in a stronger way Facebook put out another blog post saying that Cambridge Analytica and the researcher who provided them the data Aleksandr Kogan had agreed to a digital forensics audit to prove they deleted it Facebook said the one person who didnt agree to the audit was Christopher Wylie the former Cambridge Analytica contractor who spoke to the newspapers about the data leak With the post Facebook aimed to stir more skepticism around Wylies information according to a person familiar with the matter That didnt resolve things quickly either The auditors were already on site at Cambridge Analyticas London office Monday when they had to pause their work The UK Information Commissioners Office is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation The Cambridge Analytica saga is the latest in a series of bungled Facebook responses often reactionary and sometimes unintentionally stirring public outrage instead of resolving concerns The companys interaction with the public tends to start with a carefully crafted blog post and then evolve into a much more improvised Twitter-based conversation with lower-level executives who defend the social network and explain its decisions It doesnt always go well Earlier this year when the US government indicted 13 Russians who used Facebook to manipulate voters a Facebook advertising executive took to Twitter to clarify that overall the Russian ads were primarily used to divide Americans not influence the election His comments went viral after President Donald Trump used them to back up attacks on the fake news media In 2017 Facebook made its disclosures on Russias activities in a slow drip each time illustrating a bigger problem An April white paper on information operations for example didnt name the country The company that October said 10 million users saw Russias ads Later that month Facebook said 126 million people saw Russias posts in general The company upped the number to 150 million during Congressional interrogation when a senator asked if Facebook could include Instagram the photo-sharing app it owns in the count Stamos who has favored more forthright disclosure was frequently outvoted according to the New York Times Hes planning to leave the company in August the newspaper reported On Twitter he later said hes still fully engaged with his work at Facebook without answering questions about his plans But that would make him the most high-profile exit since Facebooks election-related troubles began Meanwhile higher ranking executives remain quiet Zuckerberg and Sandberg who in past years would post frequently about the issues of the day have shied away from reacting to the most controversial news Lawmakers have now called out Zuckerberg by name in both the US and the UK Zuckerberg and Sandberg plan to remain quiet on the Cambridge Analytica situation until the company completes its internal review of what happened according to a person familiar with the matter Until they do questions about Facebooks ability to cope with the Cambridge Analytica crisis will undoubtedly persist;News;Business;Tue, March 20, 2018 12:43

838;Putin cruises to landslide election win;Vladimir Putin cruised to victory in Russias presidential election on Sunday giving him at least another six years in power as Moscows relations with the West become increasingly strained Putin who has ruled Russia for almost two decades recorded his best ever election performance with more than 76 percent of the vote but the opposition cried foul Monitors reported ballot stuffing and other cases of alleged fraud as the Kremlin pushed for a high turnout to give greater legitimacy to Putins historic fourth term The Russian strongman ran against seven other candidates but his most vocal critic Alexei Navalny was barred from the ballot for legal reasons and the final outcome was never in doubt I see in this result the confidence and hope of our people Putin said in an address to a crowd of supporters on a square next to the Kremlin after exit polls put him on track for a resounding victory Our thoughts will turn to the future of our great country and the future of our children said the man who is already Russias longest-serving leader since Stalin About 107 million Russians were eligible to cast ballots and in its latest update on participation three hours before polls closed in Moscow the central election commission said turnout was at 60 percent Authorities used both the carrot and the stick to boost engagement in the polls Selfie competitions giveaways food festivals and childrens entertainers were laid on at polling stations in a bid to create a festive atmosphere around the election But employees of state and private companies reported coming under pressure to vote while students were threatened with problems in their exams or even expulsion if they did not take part according to the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper According to central election commission data with 90 percent of ballots counted Putin took 764 percent of the vote well ahead of his nearest competitor Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin who was on 12 percent Ultra-nationalist firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky took around 6 percent former reality TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak was on 15 percent and other candidates were on less than a single percentage point each The election was held as Russia faces increasing isolation on the world stage over a spy poisoning in Britain and a fresh round of US sanctions just as it gears up for the football World Cup in the summer Navalny -- who called on his supporters to boycott the fake vote and sent more than 33000 observers across the country to see how official turnout figures differed from those of monitors -- said there had been unprecedented violations His lawyer Ivan Zhdanov said the actual national turnout at 1700 GMT when polls closed in Moscow was 55 percent according to data collected by monitors Navalnys opposition movement and the non-governmental election monitor Golos reported ballot stuffing repeat voting and Putin supporters being bussed into polling stations en masse One election commission worker in the republic of Dagestan which traditionally registers extremely high official turnout figures told AFP around 50 men entered the station where he was working and physically assaulted an observer before stuffing a ballot box But the electoral commission dismissed most concerns saying monitors sometimes misinterpret what they see Runner-up Grudinin said the elections had been dishonest in comments carried by news agencies following early results Among the first world leaders to congratulate Putin was Chinese President Xi Jinping who has just been handed a second term himself and has gained a path to indefinite rule after presidential term limits were lifted last week China is willing to work with Russia to keep promoting China-Russia relations to a higher level provide driving force for respective national development in both countries and promote regional and global peace and tranquility Xi said in his message Since first being elected president in 2000 Putin has stamped his total authority on the worlds biggest country muzzling opposition putting television under state control and reasserting Moscows standing abroad The 65-year-old former KGB officer used an otherwise lacklustre presidential campaign to emphasise Russias role as a major world power boasting of its invincible new nuclear weapons in a pre-election speech Most people who spoke to AFP on Sunday said they voted for Putin praising him for restoring stability and national pride after the humiliating collapse of the Soviet Union Of course Im for Putin hes a leader said Olga Matyunina a 65-year-old retired economist After he brought Crimea back he became a hero to me Sunday marked four years since Putin signed a treaty declaring Crimea to be part of Russia in a move that triggered a pro-Kremlin insurgency in east Ukraine a conflict that has claimed more than 10000 lives Ahead of the vote a new crisis broke out with the West as Britain implicated Putin in the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal with a Soviet-designed nerve agent In response London expelled 23 Russian diplomats prompting a tit-for-tat move by Moscow Also this week Washington hit Russia with sanctions for trying to influence the 2016 US election After his victory Putin dismissed claimsRussia was behind the poisoning in Britain as drivel rubbish nonsense but said Moscow was ready to cooperate with London in the probe Putins previous Kremlin term was marked by a crackdown on the opposition after huge protests the Ukraine conflict military intervention in Syria and the introduction of Western sanctions that contributed to a fall in living standards The president has said he will use his fourth term to address a litany of domestic problems including widespread poverty and poor healthcare Election officials flew to far-flung regions to collect votes from indigenous herders while cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov -- the only

874;Myanmars ethnic Rakhine seek Muslim-free buffer zone;Buddhist flags hang limply from bamboo poles at the entrance to Koe Tan Kauk a model village for ethnic Rakhine migrants shuttled north to repopulate an area once dominated by Rohingya Muslims The new arrivals are moving to parts of Rakhine state mostly cleared of its Rohingya residents whose villages were bulldozed and reduced to muddy stains on a landscape of lush farmland The Rakhine migrants who come from the poor but relatively stable south are -- for now -- few in number But they carry great expectations as the pioneers of a donor-led Rakhinisation plan to upend the demography of the once majority-Muslim area We were really afraid of those Kalars and didnt plan to come here Chit San Eain a 28-year-old who has moved with her husband and toddler into a basic hut in Koe Tan Kauk tells AFP using a pejorative term for Muslims But now that they are no longer here we have the chance to meet again with our relatives who live up here she addedthe ruins of a Rohingya settlement lying a few kilometres away Nearly 700000 Rohingya have been driven from northern Rakhine into Bangladesh since August 25 last year by a Myanmar army offensive against Muslim militants Another 300000 Rohingya were pushed out from the south and centre of Rakhine by army campaigns stretching back to the late 1970s The UN has branded last years military crackdown ethnic cleansing with a top official saying it carried all the hallmarks of genocide Myanmar vigorously denies the allegations and says refugees are welcome to return But so far it has agreed to allow back only 374 of 8000 refugees whose names have been put forward for the initial phase of repatriation Many traumatised Rohingya in Coxs Bazar camps arealso refusing to be repatriated to Rakhine -- where holding camps and hostile neighbours await them In their absence a blizzard of development projects government and army-sponsored or privately funded are transforming northern Rakhine Taking space vacated by fleeing Rohingya is an old game in a state seen as the frontline of a Buddhist nations fight against encroaching Islam The military has been engineering the social landscape of northern Rakhine State so as to dilute the Rohingya population since the early 1990s says Francis Wade author of Myanmars Enemy Within Buddhist Violence and the Making of the Muslim Other The Muslim minority are denied citizenship and labelled Bengalis outsiders who -- the logic runs -- have successfully been pushed back to their country of origin In a pattern with echoes of the Israeli settler project in the West Bank Buddhist communities then move in altering the facts on the ground gradually rubbing out Muslim rights to the land he added Id expect to see more Buddhists settle there over the coming years And then well forget what the area once was and that process of erasure will be complete Chit San Ean is the beneficiary of the Ancillary Committee for the Reconstruction of Rakhine National Territory in the Western Frontier CRR a private scheme established shortly after the refugee crisis began In a zone under a strict army lockdown the resettlement plan could not fly without military consent Funded by ethnic Rakhine donors the CRRs ambition is to establish a Muslim-dry buffer zone running the nearly 100 kilometres from state capital Sittwe to Maungdaw town according to Oo Hla Saw a Rakhine MP who advises the committee All of this area was under the influence of Muslims After the military operations they had to flee so we have to establish this area with the Rakhine population he told AFP The CRR will fund jobs and homes so this little population can grow and grow he added Its a trickle so far with around 64 households -- some 250 people -- moved by the CRR with 200 more families on a waiting list They are among the poorest of the poor mostly daily wage labourers from Thandwe around 600 kilometres to the south or squatters from Sittwe Two village tracts Koe Tan Kuak near Rathedaung and Inn Din near Maungdaw have been designated for the scheme so far The army concedes the second site was the scene of extrajudicial killings of Rohingya captives as violence engulfed the region last August Koe Tan Kauk was a similarly mixed settlement of Buddhist and Muslim homes The CRR-sponsored hamlet promises a rudimentary existence There is little work no electricity or running water but donors have gifted each family a 450 shack on stilts made from plywood and metal sheeting New residents hope to eventually own land a prospect previously beyond their reach in Myanmars second-poorest state Rakhine nationalists say the CRR is a bulwark against Islam and a means to ensure their ethnic group has a say in development projects driven by the Burmese-dominated central state who they distrust deeply Who should be given priority other than Rakhines in Rakhine State explained Than Tun General Secretary of the CRR For its part Myanmars government has enlisted powerful businessmen to rebuild the infrastructure of the battered state The army is running other projects including beefing up its security apparatus -- in what appears to be a multi-pronged effort to keep out the Rohingya An Amnesty International report this week detailed how roads helipads and security installations are being built often on top of razed Rohingya settlements They labelled the activity a massive land grab that threatens to erase evidence of alleged atrocities including at Inn Din Across northern Rakhine abandoned land and rice fields have been commandeered by the army in an area with access tightly controlled to media investigators and most aid groups The Rohingya lost their legal status in 1982 under a junta-era Citizenship Law Now their ancestral lands are being stripped away That makes return impossible according to lawmaker Oo Hla Saw These people want to be recognised as Rohingya ethnicity to enjoy citizenship to resettle in their native grounds he says Their demands are unreasonable Despite their dangerous new neighbourhood the arrivals at Koe Tan Kauk say they are there to stay I will end my life here said a

902;Why blaming superstition for tigers death is wrong;Batang Natal a remote district on the western coast of Sumatra grabbed international headlines last week when dozens of villagers reportedly killed and hanged an endangered tiger after mistaking it for a shape-shifter siluman Foreign news outlets such as The Independent The Washington Post and The New York Post highlighted how local belief had driven the villagers in Hatupangan village in Batang Natal to slay the two-year-old male Sumatran tiger But a University of Indonesia UI anthropologist who has studied human-wildlife relations in Batang Natal doubted that local belief was what drove the villagers to attack the tiger I am not sure that a belief was what pushed them to kill There must be another reason Sundjaya told The Jakarta Post in a recent interview He argued that local belief had for decades served as a guideline for peaceful coexistence between humans and tigers in Batang Natal It is possible that such belief has been forgotten or is no longer effective Sundjaya said If anything he warned that putting the blame on the villagers belief could divert peoples attention from the real culprit behind the incident environmental degradation affecting both humans and big cats Peaceful coexistence Sundjaya who has worked with conservation groups since 1999 conducted his study in 2004 the same year that Batang Gadis National Park located near the village and believed to be the habitat of the slain tiger was established The study examined the relationship between communities and natural biodiversity in the national park surveying the situation in 10 villages According to his findings all of the villages had historic contact with tigers He recalled staying at the house of a villager when he was conducting the study in 2004 The owner casually told him that the night before he stayed at the house a tiger slept underneath his stilt house The owner even showed the tigers footsteps to Sundjaya showing no signs of concern It was a far cry from what happened in Batang Natal recently when another tiger sleeping under a stilt house was repeatedly stabbed with spears Villagers hostility toward tigers had only happened recently said Sundjaya The relationship between villagers and tigers at least until 2004 had not been as sour as the current perception When I was there I never received reports about humans harming tigers Sundjaya said There was a perception among locals that tigers had a mythological connection with their origin Tiger Feared grandmother leader The anthropologist found that locals tended to be fearful of tigers when for instance the latter marauded their villages but this did not drive locals to slay the animals in revenge Instead locals regarded tigers highly in their cultural system and even referred to the animals as nenek grandmother or datuk leader When a tiger marauded a village the locals perceived it as a sign that the villagers had done something wrong They refused to call the animal a tiger If they did that they believed it would come to their village The thinking was Dont do wrong if you dont want tigers to haunt you It served as a symbol of how they regarded tigers in their culture But what I dont know is the cultural changes that might have occurred there Sundjaya said It is said that individual gold miners from other regions have been operating in Batang Gadis Environmental news portal mongabaycoid reported in 2014 that the majority of individual miners in the Batang Gadis area were from regions on neighboring Java island such as Surabaya and Bogor When a lot of outsiders come to an area it affects how people there perceive a mythological belief Its possible that the belief is no longer seen as functional said Sundjaya Real versus unreal issues Batang Natal subdistrict head Lion Muslim Nasution claimed that Hatupangan villagers were aware tigers were an endangered species but they were so consumed by fear that they decided to kill the tiger Amrin a local resident claimed that even after killing the tiger the villagers had yet to recover from the trauma caused by the tiger shape-shifter issue Amrin admitted that he had never seen the silumantiger claiming that only people with supernatural powers could do that I dont have it so I dont know what it looks like but I believe it exists he said Regardless of whether the whole village believed the siluman rumor the way the villagers responded to the shape-shifter rumor  through violence and not a special ritual led by a shaman for example  was odd Sundjaya said Local authorities share Sundjayas suspicion alleging that certain parties illegal loggers and animal traders  had spread the shape-shifter rumor to advance their interests The fact is that they killed the tiger sadistically The shape-shifter thing is only an issue used by a particular group to cow the villagers said Hotmauli Sianturi head of North Sumatra Natural Resources Conservation Agency BKSDA Sundjaya has called on the authorities to just focus on the real issues What is clear is that the real problems are that the natural lands have been converted and the ecosystem has changed he said Since its establishment in 2004 Batang Gadis National Park has been facing several threats to its ecosystem in the form of extractive activities most notably gold mining and palm oil businesses Environmental group JATAM for instance claimed that 37 percent of the Batang Gadis national park area overlapped with the concession of a mining firm In 2009 the Supreme Court ruled in
